# Mumblecusser

From *Mumblecusser: And Other Poems*[^1]

## Text

Hiking with my nine-year-old son last August,
a hot day through cool pines, he turned and said,
"Dadda, did you just say the eff word?" Abashed, caught,
I suppose I did. I know I did. An inadvertent exhalation.
*Fuuhbbuck.* The boy startling me awake from some
poisonous revery, resentment and regret banging
around inside my head, knocking me out of the present,
away from the chance to watch my son balance, arms wide,
along the imaginary, high-wire edge of the trail; reliving
instead, for the thousandth time, some small slight, some insult,
or maybe thinking about my own misstep, the awful thing
I said, when a word left its barrel to spin toward someone
dear to me, never to be called back. *Asshole*, I mumble.
The word as likely meant for me as otherwise; breathing
it out slow, a whisper, a secret, a luminous sibilant hiss.
*Sonofabitch,* and man, that satisfies, like chewing a hangnail,
the glory of the profane, the transgressive. *Motherfucker.*
Sometimes it slips out, as inadvertent as a hammer
against a knee, drawing stares in the bookstore, restaurants,
elevators. Am I the only one? I can't be the only one.
How I keep inhabiting the ugliest moments, the landscape
of insults and embarrassments, at the expense
of the gorgeous and elusive now. *Goddamn* but I've got
some work to do. I'm aware. And I'll get to it eventually,
I suppose. But not just yet, not just now. And especially not
these days.

*Bastards.*
