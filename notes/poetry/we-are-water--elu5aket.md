# We Are Water

## Observations
- [interpretation] A love poem that reframes anger and struggle as natural forces rather than problems to solve.
- [theme] Living with outrage rather than against it - the river and rocks metaphor.
- [theme] Mutual transformation - "shaping and being shaped."
- [interpretation] Water as both gentle ("quiet and patient") and powerful ("cutting, over time").
- [claim] The profanity in the final line lands with force precisely because the poem is otherwise tender.
- [question] Is this addressed to a spouse, or to a broader "we"?

## Notable Lines
"We will live with our outrage the way a river lives with its rocks, shaping and being shaped."

"You are water, my love; you are water to me, quiet and patient and strong."

## Notes
Brief but powerful. The extended water metaphor carries emotional weight - patience as erosion, love as geological force. The sudden profanity in the closing turns tenderness into defiance.
