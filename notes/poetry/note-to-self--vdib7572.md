# Note to Self

## Observations
- [interpretation] A meditation on human existence that moves from biological facts to philosophical wonder.
- [theme] The paradox of insignificance and extraordinariness - "You are only one among 8 billion, nothing special. And yet you are extraordinary."
- [theme] The body as a biological vessel - salt water, electricity, bacteria, genes.
- [interpretation] The repetition of "sooner than you had expected" bookends mortality and astonishment.
- [claim] Uses scientific facts as a gateway to existential reflection.
- [question] Is the "commentary from the dead" a reference to inherited traits or actual spiritual presence?

## Notable Lines
"You are salt water, mostly; you are electricity, dancing."

"Genetically, we are summations of our dead."

"You are a stone under a stream of exploding stars."

## Notes
Opens the collection with a direct address to the self. The poem accumulates biological and scientific observations before pivoting to the emotional and spiritual. The ending mirrors the opening - mortality arrives "sooner than you had expected" but so does astonishment.
