# Note to Self

From *Mumblecusser: And Other Poems*[^1]

## Text

You are salt water, mostly; you are electricity,
dancing. You are an inexplicable eruption
of awareness in a void. Your brain, 2 percent
of your body mass, accounts for 20 percent of
your calorie burn. You retain your fingerprints,
although the skin is replaced every 27 days.
Bowel to belly to tongue, you are host to 5 pounds
of bacteria. A species of mite on your scalp
is distinct from a species of mite on your nose.
Spouses, over time, come to carry each other's biota.
Genetically, we are summations of our dead.
You are a delivery mechanism for your genes.
The dead may offer commentary but it will tilt
toward sarcasm. You will be carried by the living,
and sooner than you had expected. The multitude
of small kindnesses occurring in the world (now
and now) are somehow enough to counterbalance
the rare monstrosities. It's a wash. The dead tilt
toward astonishment. Intellect and reason argue
against arrogance. You are only one among 8 billion,
nothing special. And yet you are extraordinary.
The universe has never seen anything quite like you.
You are a stone under a stream of exploding stars.
You will be astonished, and sooner than you
had expected.
