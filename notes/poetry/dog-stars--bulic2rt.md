# Dog Stars

## Observations
- [interpretation] A rejection of inherited mythology in favor of personal constellations.
- [theme] The tension between cosmic scale and domestic life.
- [theme] Memory as a way of staking claim against the infinite.
- [interpretation] The poem moves from ancient constellations (Pleiades, Ursa) to personal ones (Henry the Lab, grandfather's four fingers, a mule deer buck).
- [claim] Grounds cosmic wonder in the deeply ordinary - "Costco mums," "Covid masks," "crayons and glue sticks."
- [question] What does it mean that the personal "year" replaces the Chinese zodiac?

## Notable Lines
"Like you, I have a hard time with constellations."

"Why not our stories, is my thought."

"They just go on forever. They just go on forever."

## Notes
The poem's power comes from the collision of infinity with the mundane. References a specific time (Covid, Facebook arguments) grounding the cosmic in a particular moment. The repetition at the end enacts the helplessness of staring at stars.
