# Tuesday Morning Sermon

From *Mumblecusser: And Other Poems*[^1]

## Text

We'll get started as soon as the rest arrive
Thank you for coming, thank you, yes, thank you.
There's more chairs there in the hallway.
Okay, good. You probably heard the rumors.
They're true, more or less. I spoke to God,
and just yesterday. He said to say hello.
You all should get more rest, he said. You're looking tired.
And for Christ's sake, don't be so hard on yourselves.
You're only human, and that's his fault.
About disappointment. Career, family, friends.
You might want to look first at your expectations.
We're all struggling, he said. Can you hear me
in the back? Okay, thanks. You've been spending
your mornings in dialogue with certain regrets
and grievances, gnawing around that familiar gristle.
A question: When will you be done? Remember
that your life has days the way a wall has bricks.
Tomorrow is a tossup. On the beach, a wave
is already rolling that will, when it breaks, catch
the light just so, illuminating the bait fish suspended
in its belly. In the brush beside the Yellowstone River,
a whitetail fawn nudges its mother for milk.
They stand together, dappled in cottonwood light,
hidden from every other living thing. God said
pay attention. You should take what you can get,
spirit wise. You've got your breaking wave,
you've got your fawn. Otherwise, it's iffy.
Questions so far?
