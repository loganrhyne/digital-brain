# Tuesday Morning Sermon

## Observations
- [interpretation] God as a casual, slightly weary speaker at a community meeting.
- [theme] Divine advice rendered in everyday language - "don't be so hard on yourselves."
- [theme] Disappointment as a failure of expectations, not of life itself.
- [interpretation] The mundane made sacred - a fawn nursing, a wave catching light, these are what God offers.
- [claim] Humor and tenderness coexist throughout - "Questions so far?"
- [question] Is the "iffy" ending hopeful or resigned?

## Notable Lines
"You're only human, and that's his fault."

"Remember that your life has days the way a wall has bricks."

"You should take what you can get, spirit wise."

## Notes
The voice is perfect - God as folksy, slightly exasperated, genuinely caring. The Yellowstone River reference again grounds the cosmic in Montana. The ending ("Otherwise, it's iffy") refuses to promise more than honest uncertainty.
