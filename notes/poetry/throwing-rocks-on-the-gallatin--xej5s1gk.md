# Throwing Rocks on the Gallatin

## Observations
- [interpretation] A father watching his son throw rocks into a river, finding the particular within the infinite.
- [theme] The Gallatin River as both setting and symbol - Montana specificity.
- [theme] Infinite vs. singular - countless stones, but only one that matters.
- [interpretation] "Fine and pleasant plop" - childlike sound as the poem's emotional center.
- [claim] The shortest poem of the five, achieving maximum effect through restraint.
- [question] Does "as it found its place" suggest belonging, or simply physics?

## Notable Lines
"Consider the carpet of them, the infinite floor"

"son, oh yours was the only one to make such a fine and pleasant plop as it found its place."

## Notes
Pure fatherhood poem. The "oh" in the final stanza carries all the emotion - a sigh of recognition. The Gallatin River flows through Bozeman, grounding this in Jones's home landscape.
