- [question] What substitutions work well?

## Ingredients
- 3 lb. sweet potatoes, any color (6 small or 3 large), scrubbed
- 6 tbsp. unsalted butter, room temperature
- 1/4 cup fresh lime juice
- 2 tbsp. tahini
- 1 tbsp. soy sauce
- 2 tsp. toasted sesame oil
- kosher salt, freshly ground pepper
- flaky sea salt
- toasted sesame seeds and lime wedges (for serving)

## Instructions
1. Bring a few inches of water to a boil in a medium pot fitted with a steamer basket. Halve sweet potatoes crosswise if large and place in steamer. Cover, reduce heat to medium, and steam until fork-tender, 25-30 minutes.
2. Meanwhile, smash together butter, lime juice, tahini, soy sauce, and sesame oil in a small bowl with a fork until smooth, about 3 minutes. Season tahini butter with kosher salt and lots of pepper.
3. Arrange sweet potatoes on a platter or a large plate. Let cool until you can just handle them, then split open and generously spread tahini butter over. Season with sea salt; top liberally with sesame seeds. Serve with lime wedges (this dish really comes alive with lots of bright citrus).
