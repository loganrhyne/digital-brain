- 1 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 cup wild rice blend
- 1/2 yellow onion (about 3/4-1 cup, diced)
- 2 cloves garlic (minced)
- 3 cups assorted mushrooms (chopped. i used maitake, oyster, and shiitake)
- 1/2 tsp dried rosemary
- 1/2 tsp dried thyme
- 2 1/2 cups veggie broth or 2 1/2 cups water + 2 tsp veggie bouillon paste
- 1 roasted red pepper (seeds removed)
- 2 tbsp sweet potato flesh (scooped from baked sweet potatoes)
- 1 small garlic clove (chopped)
- 1 tsp smoked paprika
- 2 tsp fresh lemon juice
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 2 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 cup chopped pecans
- 1 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
- 1 tsp fresh rosemary
- 1/2 tsp garlic powder
- 1/2 tsp salt

## Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 375 deg F.
2. Poke fork holes into the sweet potatoes, then rub a bit of oil onto each one. Place them on a baking sheet and bake for 45 minutes, or until very tender.
3. While the sweet potatoes are in the oven, make the rest of the items.
4. Saute diced onion in a saucepan on medium heat. When tender, add the garlic, mushrooms, wild rice blend, rosemary, thyme and vegetable broth. Bring it to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer. Place a lid over the pan, keeping it ajar, and cook for 30 minutes, or until the rice is tender. Season with salt and pepper and add more to taste if necessary. Set aside and keep warm until ready to fill sweet potatoes.
5. Once the cooked sweet potatoes are out of the oven and cool enough to handle, cut them in half. Scoop out the center of each sweet potato--about half of the flesh--and set it aside.
