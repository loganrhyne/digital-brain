## Ingredients
- 1 cup farro
- 2 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, divided
- 2 cups whole almonds (about 10 ounces)
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 2 cups pitted dates (about 12 ounces)
- 1 bunch flat-leaf kale (about 7 ounces)
- 1/2 medium head red cabbage (about 8 ounces)
- 4 medium lemons
- 6 ounces pecorino cheese, finely grated (about 1 1/2 cups)
- 1 tablespoon dijon mustard
- 2 cloves garlic
- 3/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 1/4 cup olive oil

## Instructions
1. Cook the farro: Place 1 cup farro in a fine-mesh strainer, rinse under cold water, and set aside to drain. Bring 6 cups of water to a boil in a large pot over high heat. Stir in the farro and 2 teaspoons of the kosher salt. Boil until the farro is tender but still slightly chewy, 10 to 15 minutes for pearled and 25 to 30 minutes for semi-pearled. Meanwhile, make the dressing and prepare the almonds and slaw.
2. Make the dressing: Prep the following and add to a blender: Finely grated the zest of 4 medium lemons (about 4 tablespoons). Juice the lemons (about 1/2 cup). Finely grate 6 ounces Pecorino cheese (about 1 1/2 cups). Add 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard, 2 garlic cloves, and 3/4 teaspoon black pepper to the blender.
3. Blend until the cheese is broken down and the mixture is smooth, adding 1 to 2 tablespoons of warm water to the blender if needed to keep it moving, about 20 seconds. With the motor running, remove the inner cap on the lid and slowly pour in 1/4 cup olive oil. Continue to blend until creamy and emulsified, about 30 seconds more.
4. Prepare the almonds: Place 2 cups almonds, 1 tablespoon olive oil, the remaining 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper in a medium skillet over medium heat. Cook, stirring constantly, until the almonds darken in color slightly and are very fragrant, 6 to 8 minutes. Immediately transfer onto a paper towel-lined plate. Let cool for 10 minutes, then coarsely chop.
5. Prepare the slaw: Prep the following and add to a large bowl: Cut 2 cups pitted dates into bite-sized pieces. Strip the stems from 1 bunch lacinato kale, stack the leaves, and thinly slice into ribbons (about 8 cups). Core and thinly slice 1/2 medium head of red cabbage into ribbons (about 8 cups).
6. When the farro is ready, drain thoroughly and rinse under cold water to quickly cool it off. Transfer onto a paper towel-lined baking sheet and pat dry, Transfer to the bowl of vegetables. Add the almonds and 1/4 cup of the dressing. Use your hands to toss everything together, making sure everything is coated well.
