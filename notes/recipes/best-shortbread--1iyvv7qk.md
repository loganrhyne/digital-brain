## Ingredients
- Oats (to be ground into 1/4 to 1/3 cup oat flour)
- All-purpose flour
- Cornstarch
- Sugar
- Salt
- Butter

## Instructions
1. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 450°F.
2. Pulse oats in spice grinder or blender until reduced to fine powder, about ten 5-second pulses (you should have 1/4 to 1/3 cup oat flour).
3. In bowl of stand mixer fitted with paddle attachment, mix oat flour, all-purpose flour, cornstarch, sugar, and salt on low speed until combined, about 5 seconds.
4. Add butter to dry ingredients and continue to mix on low speed until dough just forms and pulls away from sides of bowl, 5 to 10 minutes.
5. Place upside-down collar of 9- or 9 1/2-inch springform pan on parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet (grooved edge should be at top). Do not use springform pan bottom.
6. Press dough into collar in even 1/2-inch-thick layer, smoothing top with back of spoon.
7. Place 2-inch biscuit cutter in center of dough and cut out center. Place extracted round alongside springform collar on baking sheet and replace cutter in center of dough.
8. Open springform collar, but leave it in place.
9. Bake shortbread 5 minutes, then reduce oven temperature to 250°F.
10. Continue to bake until edges turn pale golden, 10 to 15 minutes longer.
11. Remove baking sheet from oven; turn off oven. Remove springform pan collar.
12. Use chef's knife to score surface of shortbread into 16 even wedges, cutting halfway through.
13. Using wooden skewer, poke 8 to 10 holes in each wedge.
14. Return shortbread to oven and prop door open with handle of wooden spoon, leaving 1-inch gap at top.
15. Allow shortbread to dry in turned-off oven until pale golden in center (should be firm but giving to touch), about 1 hour.
16. Transfer baking sheet to wire rack; cool shortbread to room temperature, at least 2 hours.
17. Cut shortbread at scored marks to separate and serve.
