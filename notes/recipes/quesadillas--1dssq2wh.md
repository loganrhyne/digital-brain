# Quesadillas

## Observations
- [definition] Recipe for Quesadillas.
- [claim] Published March 1, 2005.
- [claim] Makes 2 folded 8-inch quesadillas.
- [claim] Use light hand when seasoning with kosher salt, as cheese is rather salty.
- [claim] Cooling quesadillas before cutting is important - straight from skillet, cheese is molten and will ooze out.
- [claim] Advise against using sharp or aged cheddar cheese - both tend to separate and turn greasy.
- [claim] Toast tortilla until soft and puffed, about 2 minutes per side.
- [claim] Cook quesadillas until crisp and well browned, 1-2 minutes per side.
- [claim] Cool about 3 minutes before cutting.
- [claim] Finished quesadillas can be held on baking sheet in 200°F oven for up to 20 minutes.
- [claim] Serve with salsa, guacamole, or sour cream.
- [todo] Ingredients section was truncated - need to extract tortilla type, cheese quantity and type, jalapeño amount, and oil type.
- [question] What substitutions work well?
