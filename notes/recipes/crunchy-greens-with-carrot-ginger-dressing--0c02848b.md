- [question] What substitutions work well?

## Ingredients
- 1 small carrot, peeled and coarsely chopped
- 1 (1-inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled and coarsely chopped
- 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
- 2 tablespoons rice vinegar
- 1 1/2 teaspoons soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon granulated sugar
- 1 teaspoon onion powder
- salt
- 2 to 4 heads little gem lettuce, leaves separated, or 1 romaine heart, chopped
- 1 cup loosely packed fresh mint leaves

## Instructions
1. Make the dressing: In a food processor, puree the carrot, ginger, olive oil, rice vinegar, soy sauce, sugar, onion powder, a pinch of salt and 1 tablespoon cold water until as smooth as possible, 1 to 2 minutes.
2. Dress the salad: Place the lettuce leaves in a large serving bowl. Add a couple of tablespoons of the dressing and toss, then add more as needed to evenly coat. The salad should be lightly dressed, not drowned; don't use every drop of dressing if you don't need to. Taste for seasoning, adjusting with more salt as desired. Top the salad with the mint leaves and serve immediately.
