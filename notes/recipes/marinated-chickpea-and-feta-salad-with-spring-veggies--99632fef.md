## Ingredients
- 1/2 cup farro
- 6 cups water
- 2 1/4 teaspoons kosher salt, divided, plus more as needed
- 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
- 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
- 1 medium lemon
- 2 teaspoons dried oregano
- freshly ground black pepper
- 1 small shallot
- 1 clove garlic
- 4 ounces feta cheese
- 1 (15-ounce) can chickpeas
- 6 small radishes
- 4 ounces sugar snap peas
- 1 medium avocado
- 1/4 cup loosely packed fresh dill
- 1 large or 2 small romaine lettuce hearts

## Instructions
1. Cook the farro: Place 1/2 cup farro in a fine-mesh strainer, rinse under cool running water, and set aside to drain. Bring 6 cups water to a boil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Stir in the farro and 1 teaspoon of the kosher salt. Boil until the farro is tender but has a slight chew in the center, 10 to 15 minutes for pearled and 25 to 30 minutes for semi-pearled. Drain thoroughly, spread out onto a rimmed baking sheet or transfer to a metal bowl, and refrigerate to cool. Meanwhile, make the marinade.
2. Make the marinade: Place 1/4 cup olive oil and 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar in a medium bowl and whisk to combine. Finely grate the zest of 1 medium lemon into the bowl (about 2 teaspoons zest). Juice 2 tablespoons lemon juice into the bowl. Add 2 teaspoons dried oregano, the remaining 1 1/4 teaspoons kosher salt, and several grinds black pepper, and whisk to combine.
3. Prep the following ingredients, adding each one to the marinade as you complete it: Halve and thinly slice 1 small shallot (about 1/3 cup). Finely chop 1 garlic clove. Cut 4 ounces feta into 1/2-inch cubes. Drain and rinse the chickpeas. Toss to coat everything and set aside to marinate while you prep the rest of the salad, at least 20 minutes.
4. Make the salad: Prep the following ingredients, adding each one to a large bowl as you complete it: Trim and thinly slice 6 radishes (about 3/4 cup). Remove any tough strings from 4 ounces sugar snap peas (1 1/2 cups) and slice each in half diagonally. Dice 1 avocado (about 1 cup). Chop until you have 1/4 cup loosely packed fresh dill. Chop 1 large romaine heart crosswise into thin strips (2 cups). Add the cooled farro and toss to combine.
5. Pour the feta and chickpea mixture and all of the marinade into the bowl with the vegetables and gently toss to combine. Taste and season with more salt and pepper and a drizzle of olive oil as needed.
