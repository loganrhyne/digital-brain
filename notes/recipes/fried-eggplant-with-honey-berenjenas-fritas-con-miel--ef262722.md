## Observations

- [claim] Source: https://spanishsabores.com/recipe-fried-eggplant-with-honey-spanish-food/.
- [question] What substitutions work well?

## Ingredients
- 2-3 small eggplants
- milk (to cover)
- 1 tablespoon salt
- 2 teaspoon pepper
- all-purpose flour (for breading)
- good quality olive oil (an inch or two for frying)
- honey (miel) or molasses (miel de cana) (for drizzling)

## Instructions
1. Wash and dry the eggplant, then cut it into in round slices or in matchsticks, depending on your preference.
2. Place the eggplant in a bowl, then cover with milk and add a pinch of salt. Allow the eggplant to soak for at least 30 minutes, but preferably for an hour to draw out any bitterness.
3. Drain the eggplant thoroughly and pat the slices dry with paper towel.
4. Season the flour with salt and pepper if desired, then coat the slices in the flour.
5. Pour the olive oil into a pan to a depth of an inch or two, and heat it to 350-375 deg F (176-190 deg C). Fry the eggplant in batches, being careful not to not overcrowd the pan.
6. Drain the fried eggplant on paper towels to remove excess grease, then season with a pinch of salt.
7. Drizzle with honey or molasses before serving, and enjoy immediately (with salmorejo as a dipping sauce if desired).
