## Instructions

### Make Biscuits
1. Adjust an oven rack to the upper-middle position and heat the oven to 450°F.
2. Whisk the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt together in a large bowl.
3. Stir in the cream with a wooden spoon until a dough forms, about 30 seconds.
4. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and gather into a ball. Knead the dough briefly until smooth, about 30 seconds.
5. Pat the dough into a 3/4-inch-thick circle. Cut the biscuits into rounds using a 2 1/2-inch biscuit cutter or cut into 8 wedges using a knife.
6. Place the biscuits on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet. Bake until golden brown, about 15 minutes. Set aside on a wire rack.

### Make Filling
7. While the biscuits bake, pat the chicken dry with paper towels and season with salt and pepper.
8. Melt 2 tablespoons of the butter in a 12-inch skillet over medium heat until the foam subsides.
9. Brown the chicken lightly on both sides, about 5 minutes total. Transfer the chicken to a clean plate.
10. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons butter to the skillet and return to medium heat until melted.
11. Add the onion, celery, and 1/2 teaspoon salt and cook until the onion is softened, about 5 minutes.
12. Stir in the flour and cook, stirring constantly, until incorporated, about 1 minute.
13. Stir in the vermouth and cook until evaporated, about 30 seconds.
14. Slowly whisk in the broth, cream, and thyme, and bring to a simmer.
15. Nestle the chicken into the sauce, cover, and cook over medium-low heat until the thickest part of the breast registers 160°F on an instant-read thermometer, 8 to 10 minutes.
16. Transfer the chicken to a plate. Stir the peas and carrots into the sauce and simmer until heated through, about 2 minutes.
17. When the chicken is cool enough to handle, cut or shred it into bite-sized pieces and return it to the skillet.
18. Season the filling with salt and pepper to taste.
19. Place the cooked biscuits on top of the skillet or individual servings.
