# Chocolate Puddle Cookies

## Observations
- [definition] Recipe for Chocolate Puddle Cookies.
- [claim] These cookies expand significantly - like reverse Shrinky Dinks.
- [claim] Toasting depth of walnuts greatly impacts flavor - deep toasting = more intense.
- [claim] Use large eggs; extra-large may cause batter to run.
- [claim] Don't over or under bake - over = crisp, under = too floppy and hard to remove.
- [question] What substitutions work well?
