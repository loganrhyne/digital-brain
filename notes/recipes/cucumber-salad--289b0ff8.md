## Observations

- [claim] Source: https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1025369-cucumber-salad.
- [question] What substitutions work well?

## Ingredients
- 1 pound cucumbers (about 6 persian or mini seedless, or 1 english)
- salt
- 3 tablespoons vinegar (red or white wine, rice or sherry)
- 1 1/2 teaspoons honey or granulated sugar
- 1/2 small red onion, thinly sliced and rinsed under cold water
- 2 tablespoons chopped dill
- black pepper

## Instructions
1. Peel the cucumbers in alternating strips and trim ends. If desired, halve lengthwise and scoop out the seeds. Thinly slice, then transfer to a colander set in the sink. Toss with 1 teaspoon Diamond Crystal kosher salt or 1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt and set aside to drain at least 5 minutes or up to 30.
2. In a medium bowl, stir together the vinegar and honey until the honey is dissolved. Shake the cucumbers in the colander to get rid of any moisture, then transfer the cucumbers, red onion and dill to the bowl. Stir to combine, then season to taste with salt and pepper.
