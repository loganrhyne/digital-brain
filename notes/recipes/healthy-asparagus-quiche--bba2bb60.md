## Ingredients
- 3/4 cup 90 g all-purpose flour, (plus more for dusting)
- 3/4 cup (85g) whole wheat flour
- 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil
- 1/4 cup water
- 1 teaspoon extra virgin olive oil
- 1/2 onion (thinly sliced)
- 12 ounces asparagus, (cut into 1-inch pieces)
- 1 garlic clove, (minced)
- 1/2 cup grated asiago cheese (56g)
- 4 large eggs
- 1 cup 2% milk
- 1 tablespoon dijon mustard
- 1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme or tarragon leaves (optional)
- 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, (divided)
- 1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

## Instructions
1. Make the dough: Add the all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, and salt into the bowl of a food processor and pulse a few times to mix. Pour in the olive oil and pulse until evenly it's distributed through the flour. Add the water and pulse until the mixture begins to clump and is evenly moistened.
2. Knead the dough: Turn the dough onto a lightly floured work surface and lightly knead by hand until the dough comes together into a ball. Press the dough into a disk, about 1 inch thick. Wrap the disk in plastic and let it rest at room temperature for 1 hour. This resting period gives the flour time to hydrate and the gluten to relax.
3. Get ready to bake: Arrange a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 375 deg F. Dust your countertop lightly with flour. Use a floured rolling pin to roll out the dough to an 11-inch circle, about 1/8-inch thick.
4. Transfer the dough: Carefully transfer the dough into a 9-inch pie dish by rolling the dough around the rolling pin and unrolling it into the pie plate. Gently press in the dough to line the pie dish. Roll and fold the overhang of dough to build up the edges, trimming excess dough as you work around the circumference of the pie dish. Use your fingers or a fork to crimp the edges, or leave them be for a more rustic finish.
5. Blind bake the crust: Cover the crust with parchment paper or tin foil. Fill with pie weights or dried beans and bake for 20 minutes. Remove the parchment and pie weights and bake for 10 minutes.
6. Cook the vegetables: While the crust bakes, heat 1 teaspoon of olive oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add the onions and cook, stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon, until translucent and softened, about 5 min. Add the asparagus and cook until tender and bright green, another 5 minutes. Stir in the garlic and cook for 1 minute until fragrant. Remove from the heat and slide the vegetables into the blind-baked crust. Top with the grated cheese.
7. Make the egg filling: In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, Dijon mustard, herbs (if using), 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/8 teaspoon pepper. Pour the egg mixture into the crust, stopping 1/4 inch from the top. You may not use all of it, depending on the depth of your pie pan.
8. Bake, cool, slice, and serve: Bake the quiche for 30-35 minutes, or until the edges are set but the center still jiggles just a little.Remove the quiche from the oven, and cool for at least 15 minutes before slicing and serving. Serve warm, at room temperature, or cold.
