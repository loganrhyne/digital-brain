- [question] What substitutions work well?

## Ingredients
- 2 large oranges
- 1/3 cup olive oil
- 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
- 1 tablespoon honey
- 1/2 to 1 teaspoon crushed red pepper
- salt and pepper
- 1 (21/4-pound) red cabbage, cored
- 2 crisp medium apples, halved and cored
- 1 cup parsley leaves (some tender stems are okay too)
- 1/3 cup roasted, salted almonds, chopped
- 1/3 cup dried cranberries

## Instructions
1. Zest both oranges and juice one of them (you'll have about 2 tablespoons zest and 1/3 cup juice). In a large bowl, whisk together the olive oil, orange zest, orange juice, vinegar, honey and red pepper and then season with salt and pepper to taste.
2. Chop the cabbage into medium bite-sized pieces and place in the vinaigrette bowl. Cut the apple into thin slices and add to the bowl along with the parsley, almonds and cranberries. Season with salt and pepper, toss very well and serve.
