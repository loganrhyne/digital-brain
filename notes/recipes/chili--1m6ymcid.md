## Ingredients

### Basic Recipe
- 1 large onion
- 2 cloves garlic (at least)
- 1 lb lean ground beef
- 1 Tbsp chili powder
- 2 teaspoons chopped fresh (or 1 teaspoon dried) oregano leaves
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon red pepper sauce
- 1 can (14 or 15 oz) diced tomatoes, undrained
- 1 can (15 or 16 oz) red kidney beans, drained

### Optional Additions
- Green/red/orange bell peppers
- Squash
- Beer, wine, or chicken/vegetable stock (if dry)
- Cocoa or unsweetened chocolate

## Instructions
1. Peel and chop the onion. Peel and finely chop the garlic.
2. In a 3 qt saucepan, cook the beef, onion and garlic over medium heat 8 to 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until beef is thoroughly cooked. If greasy, drain off the grease.
3. Stir in the chili powder, oregano, cumin, salt, pepper sauce and tomatoes with their liquid.
4. Heat the mixture to boiling. Once mixture is boiling, reduce heat just enough so mixture bubbles gently. Cover with lid. Cook 1 hour, stirring occasionally.
5. Stir in the beans. Cook uncovered about 30 more minutes, stirring occasionally.
6. Add optional vegetables, liquids, or chocolate as desired.
