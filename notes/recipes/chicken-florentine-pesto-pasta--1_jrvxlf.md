## Ingredients
- 12-16 ounces dried short pasta (bowties, penne, gemelli, etc)
- 4 chicken breast cutlets (1 1/4 to 1 1/2 pounds total)
- Salt
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 1/2 yellow or white onion, chopped, about 1 cup
- 3 garlic cloves, minced
- 1/2 cup white wine or stock
- 8-16 ounces fresh spinach, washed, long stems removed and chopped (or frozen spinach, defrosted and drained)
- Black pepper
- 1/4 cup cream
- 1/4 cup (or more) pesto

## Instructions
1. Bring a large pot of salted water (add enough salt so that the water tastes salty) to a boil. Add the dried pasta and cook until al dente.
2. While preparing the pasta, sprinkle the chicken breasts with salt, heat the olive oil in a sauté pan and brown the chicken breasts on both sides over medium-high heat. They don't need to be cooked all the way through, just browned. Remove the chicken from the pan and set aside.
3. Add the chopped onion to the pan and sauté 2-3 minutes, stirring occasionally.
4. While the onions cook, slice the chicken into strips. Put any pieces that are cooked all the way through in one pile, and put the ones that still need a little cooking in another pile.
5. When the onions are just beginning to brown, add the garlic and cook another minute.
6. Add the white wine or stock and boil vigorously until the liquid is reduced by half.
7. Add the spinach and the undercooked pieces of chicken to the pan. Using tongs, turn them over to coat them with the juices in the pan.
8. Continue to cook, turning and stirring often, until the spinach is wilted and the chicken cooked through, about 2 minutes.
9. Turn off the heat and add some black pepper, the pile of cooked chicken pieces and the pesto. Stir to combine.
10. Drain the pasta and put it in a large bowl.
11. Add the cream to the sauté pan and stir well to combine.
12. Add the contents of the pan to the bowl with the pasta and mix well.
13. Serve at once.
