# Chai Tea

## Observations
- [definition] Recipe for Chai Tea (Masala Chai).
- [claim] Helen's family recipe for authentic Indian chai.
- [claim] Family tradition: father was "chai master," author was "junior chai master."
- [claim] Use "mamri" (little grain) tea or cheap strong black tea like Lipton Yellow Label, Jivraj No. 9, or Taj Mahal.
- [claim] Don't use high-quality whole leaf Darjeeling or Assam - too delicate for the spices.
- [claim] Masala blend from paternal great-great grandmother passed down through generations.
- [claim] Contains cloves, ginger, cinnamon, cardamom, nutmeg, and black pepper.
- [claim] Don't make with skim milk - need fat to extract flavors from spices (aromatic compounds dissolve in fats).
- [claim] Longer boiling extracts more flavor but can make tea bitter.
- [todo] Original document is very long with extensive cultural background and detailed science notes - recipe details need to be extracted from full text.
- [question] What substitutions work well?
