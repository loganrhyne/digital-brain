- [question] What substitutions work well?

## Ingredients
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1/2 cup chopped yellow or white onion
- 3 cloves garlic (finely minced or pressed through a garlic press)
- 1/2 cup diced carrots (about 2 medium carrots)
- 1/2 cup diced celery (about 2 stalks)
- 2 teaspoons ground cumin
- 1 1/2 teaspoons smoked paprika
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 pound yukon gold or red potatoes (cut into 1-inch pieces (i do not peel but you can if you want))
- 1 cup red lentils (sorted and rinsed (see note))
- 1 cup brown lentils (sorted and rinsed (see note))
- 8 cups chicken or vegetable stock or broth
- 8 to 10 ounces kale or spinach (chopped (optional but delicious))

## Instructions
1. In a stovetop or electric pressure cooker, heat the oil (use the Saute function in the Instant Pot). Add the onion, garlic, carrots, and celery, and cook for a minute or two, stirring constantly so the garlic doesn't burn.
2. Add the cumin, paprika and salt. Stir to combine.
3. Add the potatoes, lentils and stock or broth.
4. Secure the lid on the pressure cooker. Cook at 3 minutes on high pressure. Quick release the pressure, unlock the lid, and stir in the kale or spinach, if using.
5. Season to taste with salt and pepper (very important!) and serve. The soup will thicken a bit as it cools.
