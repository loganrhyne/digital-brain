## Observations
- [definition] Recipe for Chewy Chocolate Chip Cookies.
- [claim] Soft and moist (but not "wet"), absolutely packed with chocolate chips.

- [claim] Yields about 3 dozen cookies.
- [question] What substitutions work well?

## Ingredients
- 6 tablespoons (3 ounces) unsalted butter
- 1/2 cup (3 1/2 ounces) granulated sugar
- 3/4 cup (5 5/8 ounces) brown sugar, lightly packed
- 3 tablespoons (2 1/4 ounces) honey
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 1/2 teaspoon espresso powder
- 3/4 teaspoon salt
- 1 tablespoon (1/2 ounce) cider vinegar
- 1 large egg
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
- 2 cups (8 ounces) King Arthur White Whole Wheat Flour, organic preferred
- 2 2/3 to 3 cups (16 to 18 ounces) semisweet chocolate chips

## Instructions
1. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Lightly grease (or line with parchment) two baking sheets.
2. In a large bowl, beat together the butter, sugars, honey, vanilla, espresso powder, and salt till smooth.
3. Beat in the vinegar, egg, baking soda, and baking powder.
4. Stir in the flour, then the chocolate chips, mixing JUST till combined.
5. Drop the dough, by tablespoonfuls, onto the prepared baking sheets. A tablespoon cookie scoop works well here.
6. Bake the cookies for 10 to 11 minutes, until they're starting to brown around the edges.
7. Remove them from the oven, and allow them to cool for 5 minutes before transferring them to a rack to cool completely.
