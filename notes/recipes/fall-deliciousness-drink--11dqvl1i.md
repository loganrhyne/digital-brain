## Ingredients
- Apple juice
- Cinnamon sticks (handful)
- Whole cloves (handful)
- Candied ginger slices (handful)
- Bottle of whiskey
- 1 orange
- 1 apple

## Instructions
1. Dump a bunch of apple juice into a big pot, then put it on the stove. Heat to a simmer (not a boil).
2. As steam starts to rise, drop a handful of cinnamon sticks and cloves in there (the more the merrier).
3. Put a lid on the pot and let it simmer for 15 minutes with occasional stirring.
4. Once the cinnamon sticks sink, drop in a handful of candied ginger, stir some more, cover and wait some more.
5. While waiting, cut that orange in half. Squeeze juice from one half into pot, and slice the other half for garnish.
6. Slice the apple for garnish (can sprinkle cinnamon on slices).
7. Cider is ready when cloves have begun to dissolve and everything has sunk to the bottom (longer = tastier).
8. When ready, pour a double-shot of whiskey into favorite coffee cup, then fill rest of cup with hot cider.
9. Dress up with orange, apple, and candied ginger.
10. Do not pour whiskey into the hot pot - mix in cup to adjust each guest's preference.
