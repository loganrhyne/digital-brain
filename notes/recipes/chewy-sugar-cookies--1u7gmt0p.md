# Chewy Sugar Cookies

## Observations
- [definition] Recipe for Chewy Sugar Cookies.
- [claim] Source: Published November 1, 2010.
- [claim] Makes 2 dozen cookies.
- [claim] Final dough will be slightly softer than most cookie dough.
- [claim] Handle dough briefly and gently when shaping - overworking results in flatter cookies.
- [claim] Uses both baking powder (for lift) and baking soda (for spread and crackly tops).
- [claim] Cream cheese cuts sweetness and rounds out flavors.
- [claim] Oil (instead of all butter) boosts chewiness considerably.
- [todo] Original appears to have ingredients list cut off - needs reconstruction from instructions mentioning flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt, sugar, cream cheese, butter, oil, egg, milk, and vanilla.
- [question] What substitutions work well?
