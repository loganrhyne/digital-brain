# Thick, Chewy Oatmeal Raisin Cookies

## Observations
- [definition] Recipe for Thick, Chewy Oatmeal Raisin Cookies.
- [claim] Half recipe makes a couple dozen standard-size cookies.
- [claim] Chilling dough before baking makes cookies thicker.
- [claim] Can scoop and freeze for baking later - bake from frozen for thickest results.
- [claim] Bake for 10-12 minutes, taking out when golden at edges but still undercooked-looking on top.
- [claim] Let sit on hot baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to rack.
- [question] What substitutions work well?

## Ingredients
- 1/2 cup (1 stick or 4 ounces) butter, softened
- 2/3 cup light brown sugar, packed
- 1 egg
- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 3/4 cup all-purpose flour
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1/4 teaspoon salt (can use 1/2 teaspoon for more salt)
- 1 1/2 cups rolled oats
- 3/4 cup raisins
- 1/2 cup walnuts, chopped (optional)

## Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C).
2. In a large bowl, cream together the butter, brown sugar, egg and vanilla until smooth.
3. In a separate bowl, whisk the flour, baking soda, cinnamon and salt together.
4. Stir dry ingredients into the butter/sugar mixture.
5. Stir in the oats, raisins and walnuts, if using them.
6. Chill the dough: Either chill dough in fridge then scoop, or scoop cookies onto sheet and chill the whole tray before baking. (Can bake right away if impatient, but cookies will be less thick.)
7. Place cookies 2 inches apart on a parchment-lined baking sheet.
8. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes (time varies based on oven and how cold cookies were), taking them out when golden at edges but still undercooked-looking on top.
9. Let sit on hot baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to rack to cool.
