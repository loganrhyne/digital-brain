## Ingredients
- 1 (28-ounce) can diced tomatoes
- 2 (15-ounce) cans beans (combination of kidney, black, pinto), rinsed
- 2-3 teaspoons minced chipotle chiles in adobo sauce
- 2 teaspoons sugar
- Salt and ground black pepper
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 1 onion, minced
- 3 tablespoons chili powder
- 2 teaspoons ground cumin
- 3 garlic cloves, minced
- 1-1/2 cups frozen corn, thawed
- 2 tablespoons minced fresh cilantro

## Instructions
1. Pour tomatoes and the accompanying juices in a food processor. Pulse 4 or 5 times, until it's kinda chunky.
2. In a large saucepan, combine tomatoes, beans, chipotles, sugar, and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Stir and cover. Heat over high until it starts boiling. Drop heat to medium-low and simmer for the time being.
3. In a different large saucepan or Dutch oven, heat oil over medium heat. When very hot, add onion, chili powder, cumin, and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Stir. Sauté until onions are soft and a little translucent, around 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add garlic. Stir. Sauté until fragrant, 30 seconds to 1 minute.
4. Pour tomato mixture into onion pot. Scrape browned bits with the back of your spoon, if you have them. Drop heat to medium-low and cook about 15 minutes, until chili has a more chili-like consistency. Stir occasionally.
5. After 15 minutes, add corn and cilantro. Stir. Heat until corn is warmed through. Salt and pepper to taste. Serve.
