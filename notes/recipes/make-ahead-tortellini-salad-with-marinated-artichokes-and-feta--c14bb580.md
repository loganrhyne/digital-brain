1. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Meanwhile, prepare the following, adding them to a large bowl as you complete them: Mince 1 small garlic clove, thinly slice 1 small shallot (about 1/4 cup), and squeeze 2 medium lemons until you have 3 tablespoons juice.
2. Add 2 tablespoons olive oil, 1/2 teaspoon Dijon mustard, 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper, and whisk to combine.
3. Prepare the following, adding them to the vinaigrette as you complete them: Thinly slice 1 small orange bell pepper, then cut the slices in half.
