## Ingredients
- 2 sticks unsalted butter, room temperature
- 1 cup granulated sugar
- 1 cup packed dark brown sugar
- 2 large eggs
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 0.75 tsp fine salt
- 0.5 tsp baking soda

## Instructions
1. Arrange oven racks in upper and lower thirds. Preheat to 375°F. Line 2 large baking sheets with parchment.
2. Cream butter and sugars at medium-high speed until fluffy, about 5 minutes.
3. Add eggs, vanilla, salt, and baking soda. Beat at medium speed until incorporated, 1-2 minutes.
4. Add flours and mix at low speed until just blended. Stir in chocolate chips.
5. Drop 6 heaping tablespoons of dough on each sheet, spaced evenly.
6. Bake 7 minutes, switch and rotate pans, bake 5-7 more minutes until evenly golden.
7. Cool on pans 1-2 minutes, then transfer to racks. Repeat with remaining dough.
