# Miso Vegetables & Tofu

## Observations
- [definition] Recipe for Miso Vegetables & Tofu.
- [claim] Inspired by a recipe in Harumi Kurihara's Everyday Harumi (Conran, 2009).
- [claim] Serves 4-6, plus leftover dressing.
- [claim] Makes more dressing than needed - leftovers keep refrigerated for 1-2 weeks.
- [claim] Can use asparagus, broccoli, green beans, or cauliflower as vegetables.
- [claim] Have fun experimenting with different in-season ingredients.
- [claim] Simmer miso dressing for about 20 minutes until it thickens a bit.
- [claim] Blanch vegetables very briefly (no more than a minute) to take raw edge off.
- [claim] Different vegetables have different cooking times - use best judgment.
- [claim] Run vegetables under cold water immediately after blanching to stop cooking.
- [claim] Get as much water off vegetables as possible after draining.
- [claim] This particular dressing is quite strong and rich.
- [question] What substitutions work well?

## Ingredients

### Miso Dressing
- 6 oz awase miso (or blend of equal parts white & red miso)
- 1/4 cup sake
- 1/2 cup mirin
- 3 tablespoons sifted natural cane sugar
- Red pepper flakes or shichimi tōgarashi, a big pinch or two

### Vegetables and Tofu
- 4 cups / 12 oz / 340 g bite-sized veggies (asparagus, broccoli, green beans, cauliflower, etc.)
- 12 ounces / 340 g baked or grilled (or lightly pan-fried) tofu, cut into bite-sized pieces

## Instructions

### Make Miso Dressing
1. Combine miso, sake, mirin, and sugar in a small saucepan.
2. Bring just to a boil, dial down the heat and simmer gently for about 20 minutes, or until it thickens a bit.
3. Toward the end, stir in the red pepper flakes, adding to taste.
4. Remove from heat and allow to cool.

### Prepare Vegetables and Assemble
5. Bring a pot of water to a boil. Salt the water.
6. Blanch the vegetables very briefly, just long enough to take the raw edge off, no more than a minute. If using vegetables with different cooking times, add longer-cooking vegetables first.
7. Drain and immediately run under cold water to stop the cooking.
8. Drain well - try to get as much water off the vegetables as possible.
9. In a large serving bowl gently toss the vegetables until thoroughly coated with 1/3 cup / 80 ml of the miso dressing.
10. Add the tofu and toss again.
11. Taste and add more dressing if you like, keeping in mind this dressing is quite strong and rich.
12. Serve family-style or individually topped with a bit more shichimi tōgarashi or a sprinkling of red pepper flakes.
