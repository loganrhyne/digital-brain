# Swiss 2nd Pillar Pension Funding Decision for Mortgage

## Observations
- [decision] {date: 2026-01-01} Helen will fund her Swiss 2nd Pillar for 30,000 CHF in 2025, under the assumption that any 2nd pillar funds can be used against the second half of a Swiss mortgage down payment without withdrawing them.
- [decision] {date: 2026-01-01} I will NOT fund my 2nd pillar because those funds are available for actual withdrawal to use for the first portion of the down payment, having made no additional "buy-in" payments in the past three years.

## Notes

### Context
This decision relates to planning for a Swiss mortgage down payment, leveraging 2nd Pillar pension funds in two different ways:

1. **Helen's Strategy**: Fund the 2nd pillar with 30k CHF to use against the second half of the mortgage down payment (without withdrawal)
2. **My Strategy**: Keep 2nd pillar unfunded to maintain eligibility for withdrawal to cover the first portion of the down payment

### Key Assumptions
- 2nd pillar funds can be used as collateral for the second half of a Swiss mortgage down payment without requiring withdrawal
- Funds that have not received additional "buy-in" payments in the past three years remain eligible for withdrawal under Swiss pension rules
- Using withdrawn funds for the first portion and pledged funds for the second portion is a valid mortgage financing strategy

### Questions to Validate
- [question] Can 2nd pillar funds be pledged (without withdrawal) for the second 10% of a Swiss mortgage down payment?
- [question] What are the specific withdrawal eligibility rules for 2nd pillar funds that haven't received buy-in payments for 3+ years?
- [question] Are there any tax implications for Helen's 30k CHF buy-in to the 2nd pillar in 2025?
- [question] What is the optimal timing for Helen's 30k CHF contribution relative to the mortgage application?
