# Swiss 2nd Pillar Pension Funding Decision for Mortgage

## Observations
- [decision] {date: 2026-01-01} Helen will fund her Swiss 2nd Pillar for 30,000 CHF in 2025, under the assumption that any 2nd pillar funds can be used against the second half of a Swiss mortgage down payment without withdrawing them.
- [decision] {date: 2026-01-01} I will NOT fund my 2nd pillar because those funds are available for actual withdrawal to use for the first portion of the down payment, having made no additional "buy-in" payments in the past three years.

## Notes

### Context
This decision relates to planning for a Swiss mortgage down payment, leveraging 2nd Pillar pension funds in two different ways:

1. **Helen's Strategy**: Fund the 2nd pillar with 30k CHF to use against the second half of the mortgage down payment (without withdrawal)
2. **My Strategy**: Keep 2nd pillar unfunded to maintain eligibility for withdrawal to cover the first portion of the down payment

### Key Assumptions
- 2nd pillar funds can be used as collateral for the second half of a Swiss mortgage down payment without requiring withdrawal
- Funds that have not received additional "buy-in" payments in the past three years remain eligible for withdrawal under Swiss pension rules
- Using withdrawn funds for the first portion and pledged funds for the second portion is a valid mortgage financing strategy

### Research Analysis

**Author**: Claude (AI Assistant)
**Date**: 2026-01-02
**Status**: ⚠️ Critical findings - strategy requires adjustment

#### 1. Swiss Mortgage Down Payment Structure (20% Total)

**Finding**: The 20% down payment has a **mandatory split** that affects which pillar can be used for each portion.

- **First 10% ("Hard Equity")**: MUST come from personal cash savings or Pillar 3a. **Pillar 2 cannot be used for this portion** under any circumstances (withdrawal or pledge).
- **Second 10%**: CAN come from Pillar 2 via either withdrawal or pledging.

**Implication**: ⚠️ The stated assumption that "I will NOT fund my 2nd pillar because those funds are available for actual withdrawal to use for the first portion of the down payment" is **incorrect**. Pillar 2 funds cannot be withdrawn for the first 10% regardless of buy-in status. The first 10% must be hard equity.

---

#### 2. Pledging vs. Withdrawal for the Second 10%

**Finding**: Both options are valid for using Pillar 2 funds for the second 10% of the down payment.

**Withdrawal**:
- Funds are removed from Pillar 2 account
- Used directly as equity payment
- Reduces mortgage amount needed
- Reduces retirement capital and insurance coverage
- Subject to taxation at preferential rates

**Pledging**:
- Funds remain in Pillar 2 account
- Serve as collateral/guarantee for the bank
- Allows larger mortgage (up to 90% LTV instead of 80%)
- Retirement capital and insurance coverage remain intact
- **Not taxed** at time of pledge
- Bank can seize pledged assets if loan obligations aren't met

- [Promotion of home ownership in Switzerland - Helvetia](https://www.helvetia.com/ch/web/en/private-customers/guide/pension/promotion-home-ownership.html)

**Validation**: ✅ Helen's assumption that she can use pledged Pillar 2 funds for the "second half" (second 10%) without withdrawal is **correct**.

---

#### 3. The Critical 3-Year Buy-in Rule

**Finding**: If you make a voluntary buy-in to Pillar 2, you **cannot withdraw** those funds for **3 years** without severe tax penalties.

**Penalties for violating the 3-year rule**:
- Tax authorities will **retroactively cancel** the tax deduction
- You must **repay all tax savings** from the buy-in
- Additional **default interest** charges apply
- The buy-in amount made within 3 years **cannot be drawn as capital**

- [Should You Contribute To Your Second Pillar In 2025? - The Poor Swiss](https://thepoorswiss.com/should-you-contribute-to-your-second-pillar/)

**Key clarification**: The 3-year rule applies to **withdrawals only**. It does **NOT apply to pledging**. You can pledge Pillar 2 funds immediately after a buy-in without penalty.

**Validation**:
- ✅ Your assumption that funds without buy-ins in the past 3 years are available for withdrawal is **correct**.
- ⚠️ However, as noted above, Pillar 2 withdrawals can only be used for the **second 10%**, not the first.
- ✅ Helen's 30k CHF buy-in can be **pledged immediately** without waiting 3 years (but would need to wait 3 years for withdrawal).

#### 4. Tax Implications of Helen's 30k CHF Buy-in

**Finding**: Pillar 2 buy-ins offer **substantial tax benefits** with **no annual cap** (unlike Pillar 3a which is capped at CHF 7,258 in 2026).

**Expected tax savings**:
- A 30,000 CHF buy-in typically saves between **8,000-12,000 CHF** in taxes
- Exact amount depends on canton of residence and marginal tax rate
- Tax deduction is claimed in the year the buy-in is made

**Restriction**: If you have previously withdrawn Pillar 2 funds for a property purchase, you **cannot make tax-deductible buy-ins** until you have **fully repaid** those withdrawn amounts.

- [Tax deductions and Pillar 2 buybacks - Lombard Odier](https://www.lombardodier.com/contents/corporate-news/corporate/2021/october/tax-deductions-how-to-optimise-p.html)

**Validation**: ✅ Helen's 30k CHF buy-in in 2025 will provide significant tax deduction (8-12k CHF savings), assuming no prior unreimbursed property withdrawals.

#### 5. Optimal Timing Strategy

**Recommended approach based on research**:

1. **For Helen (planning to pledge)**:
   - ✅ Make the 30k CHF buy-in in 2025 to maximize tax deduction
   - ✅ Can pledge these funds **immediately** for mortgage (no 3-year waiting period for pledging)
   - ✅ Retirement capital remains intact
   - ⚠️ Ensure no prior unreimbursed property withdrawals exist

2. **For you (planning to withdraw)**:
   - ⚠️ **Critical**: Pillar 2 withdrawals can only be used for the **second 10%**, not the first 10%
   - ✅ Not making buy-ins preserves withdrawal eligibility (correct strategy for withdrawal scenario)
   - ⚠️ **Reconsider strategy**: If you need funds for the **first 10%**, you must use:
     - Personal cash savings, OR
     - Pillar 3a funds (if available)

3. **Overall mortgage financing should be**:
   - **First 10%**: Personal savings and/or Pillar 3a (NOT Pillar 2)
   - **Second 10%**: Pillar 2 - combination of:
     - Helen's pledged funds (30k CHF after buy-in)
     - Your withdrawn/pledged funds (if needed for remaining amount)

### Revised Strategy Recommendations

Based on the research findings, the original strategy needs adjustment:

**Original assumptions (partially incorrect)**:
- ❌ "Use my Pillar 2 withdrawal for the first portion" - Pillar 2 cannot be used for first 10%
- ✅ "Use Helen's pledged Pillar 2 for the second half" - Correct for second 10%

**Recommended revised strategy**:
1. **First 10% (hard equity)**: Must come from personal cash savings or Pillar 3a funds
2. **Second 10%**: Use Helen's pledged Pillar 2 (30k CHF after buy-in) + your Pillar 2 (withdrawal or pledge) if additional funds needed
3. **Helen**: Proceed with 30k CHF buy-in in 2025 for tax benefits, can pledge immediately
4. **You**: Continue not making buy-ins to preserve withdrawal flexibility for the second 10% if needed

**Next steps**:
- [question] What is the expected property purchase price to calculate exact 10%/10% amounts?
- [question] How much personal cash savings + Pillar 3a is available for the first 10%?
- [question] After Helen's 30k CHF pledge, how much additional Pillar 2 funding (if any) is needed for the second 10%?
