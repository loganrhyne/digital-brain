## Notes
The title came from a hiking trip when Jones was talking to himself and his 7-year-old son asked, "Dad, did you just say the 'F' word?"

Critical praise from Kirkus Reviews: "Jones rides into the hard country populated by the best of western writers."

Michael Earl Craig: "Allen Jones's Mumblecusser is an impressive debut book of poems. In these pages a boy has turned into a young man who's turned into a father on his way toward dust."
