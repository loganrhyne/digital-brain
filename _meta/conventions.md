# Repository Conventions

## Scope
These conventions define required structure and formatting for the digital-brain repo.

## Core Rules
- All .md files begin with YAML frontmatter containing id, type, status, created, updated, visibility.
- Substantive notes include an Observations section with typed bullets.
- Relationships are encoded as footnote JSON objects validated by `_meta/relations.schema.json`.
