# Repository Conventions

## Scope
These conventions define required structure and formatting for the digital-brain repo.

## Core Rules
- All .md files begin with YAML frontmatter containing id, type, status, created, updated, visibility.
- Substantive notes include an Observations section with typed bullets.
- Relationships are encoded as footnote JSON objects validated by `_meta/relations.schema.json`.

## Fair Use Policy for Poetry Transcription

Transcription of poems into this private digital brain repository constitutes fair use under U.S. copyright law (17 U.S.C. § 107) when:

- The poem was lawfully accessed (e.g., from a purchased book)
- The transcription is for personal use: reflection, learning, indexing, or cross-referencing
- There is no public redistribution, sale, or publication
- The use does not substitute for the original work

This is legally equivalent to writing a poem into a notebook, copying into research notes, or memorization. A digital knowledge repository is an extension of personal study and memory.

All four fair use factors support this use:
1. **Purpose**: Non-commercial, transformative (poem becomes informational object for cognition)
2. **Nature**: Creative works may be copied for non-expressive analytical purposes
3. **Amount**: Full copying permitted when purpose requires the whole work
4. **Market effect**: Private use does not diminish demand for the original

Poetry notes should always include proper attribution (poet, source collection) via footnote relations.
