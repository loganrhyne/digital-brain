## Ingredients
- 1 lb ground beef
- kosher salt
- 4 heads bokchoy
- 2 stalks celery
- 3 stalks scallion
- 2 cloves garlic, sliced
- 6 ounces mushrooms
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce
- 1 teaspoon chili sambal sauce
- black pepper
- 1 cup broth
- 1 tablespoon cornstarch
- 2 tablespoons water

## Instructions
1. Prep the vegetables - trim the mushrooms, slice the celery on a bias into 1/2" thick pieces, slice the bokchoy into 1" pieces, mince the garlic, and thinly slice the scallions.
2. Heat a pan on medium high heat. Add the ground beef and mince with a wooden spoon. Season with kosher salt and black pepper. Once browned, remove a bit of the fat if you prefer, then add the mushrooms and celery and cook for another couple minutes.
3. To the beef and mushrooms, add the bokchoy and scallions. Give this a stir, then add the chicken broth. Cook for 2-3 minutes on medium high heat, covered (or until the bokchoy is tender to your liking).
4. While waiting for the bokchoy to cook, make the cornstarch slurry with 2 tablespoons of water and 1 tablespoon of cornstarch. Mix together, then add this to the pot after it's cooked.
5. Then, season with another pinch of kosher salt, black pepper, 2 tablespoons of soy sauce, and the teaspoon of chili sambal sauce. Taste, adjust seasoning with more salt and pepper, and serve over rice.
