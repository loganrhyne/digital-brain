# Roast Potatoes

## Observations
- [definition] Recipe for Roast Potatoes.
- [claim] Published May 1, 1998.
- [claim] Serves 4.
- [claim] To roast more than 2 pounds at once, use second pan rather than crowding first.
- [claim] If potatoes are small (like new potatoes), cut in halves instead of wedges and turn cut-side up during final 10 minutes.
- [claim] Roast covered at 425°F for about 20 minutes, then uncovered for 15 minutes.
- [claim] Turn potatoes carefully using metal spatula, pressing against metal to protect crusts.
- [claim] Final roasting: 5-10 minutes until skins have raisin-like wrinkles.
- [claim] Use extra care not to rip crusts when transferring to serving dish.
- [todo] Ingredients section was truncated - need to extract potato quantity and type.
- [question] What substitutions work well?

## Ingredients
- Potatoes (quantity and type not specified, cut into wedges)
- Olive oil
- Salt and pepper

## Instructions
1. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 425°F.
2. Toss potatoes and olive oil in medium bowl to coat; season generously with salt and pepper and toss again to blend.
3. Place potatoes flesh side down, in a single layer, on shallow roasting pan; cover tightly with aluminum foil and cook about 20 minutes.
4. Remove foil; roast until side of potato touching pan is crusty golden brown, about 15 minutes more.
5. Remove pan from oven and carefully turn potatoes over using metal spatula. (Press spatula against metal as it slides under potatoes to protect crusts.)
6. Return pan to oven and roast until side of potato now touching pan is crusty golden brown and skins have raisin-like wrinkles, 5 to 10 minutes more.
7. Remove from oven, transfer potatoes to serving dish (again, using metal spatula and extra care not to rip crusts), and serve warm.
