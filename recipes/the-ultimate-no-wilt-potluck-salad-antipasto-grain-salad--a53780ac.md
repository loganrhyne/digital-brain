- [question] What substitutions work well?

## Ingredients
- 1 pound farro (about 2 1/2 cups)
- 1/3 cup plus 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, divided
- kosher salt
- 2 cloves garlic
- 1/4 cup red wine vinegar
- 1 tablespoon dried oregano
- freshly ground black pepper
- 8 ounces castelvetrano olives (1 1/2 cups), or 10 ounces pitted castelvetrano olives
- 4 ounces peppadew peppers (1 cup); use multi-colored if you can find them
- 8 large pickled pepperoncinis
- 12 ounces multi-colored cherry tomatoes (2 cups)
- 12 ounces bocconcini (small mozzarella balls), drained (2 cups)
- 1 cup loosely packed coarsely chopped fresh basil leaves
- 1/2 cup loosely packed coarsely chopped fresh parsley leaves

## Instructions
1. Cook the farro (yields 6 to 7 cups cooked farro): Place 2 1/2 cups farro in a fine-mesh strainer, rinse under cool running water, and set aside to drain. Heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil in a 6-quart or larger pot over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add the farro and toast, stirring often, until golden and nutty-smelling, about 4 minutes. Pour in 12 cups water and 1 tablespoon kosher salt and stir to combine. Increase the heat to high and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to maintain a simmer and cook uncovered until the the farro is tender but has a slight chew in the center, 10 to 15 minutes for pearled and 25 to 30 minutes for semi-pearled. (This is a good time to make the dressing.) Drain and spread onto a large baking sheet to cool.
2. Make the dressing: Mince 2 garlic cloves and place in a large bowl. Add 1/3 cup red wine vinegar, 1 tablespoon dried oregano, 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt, and several grinds black pepper, and whisk to combine. While whisking constantly, slowly drizzle in the remaining 1/3 cup olive oil and continue whisking until emulsified.
3. Make the salad: Prepare the following ingredients, adding each one to the bowl of vinaigrette as you complete it: Using the side of a chef's knife, crush 8 ounces Castelvetrano olives to release the pits; discard pits. Tear the pitted olives into large pieces (if you bought pitted olives, simply tear them into the bowl). Coarsely chop 1 cup peppadew peppers. De-stem and thinly slice 8 pepperoncinis. Halve 12 ounces cherry tomatoes. Tear 12 ounces drained bocconcini in half. Toss to coat all the ingredients in the dressing. Add the cooled farro and toss again. Taste and season with kosher salt and black pepper as needed.
4. Chop basil leaves until you have 1 loosely-packed cup. Chop parsley leaves until you get 1/2 loosely-packed cup. Just before serving, stir the herbs into the salad.
