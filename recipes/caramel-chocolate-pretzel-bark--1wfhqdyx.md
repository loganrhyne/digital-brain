## Ingredients
- 2 sticks unsalted butter
- 1 cup light brown sugar
- 1 pound bag mini pretzels (won't use whole bag)
- 12 ounce bag semi-sweet chocolate chips
- 1 pinch sea salt, for sprinkling on top

## Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 400°F.
2. Cover an 11×17 baking sheet with aluminum foil and set aside.
3. Melt 2 sticks of butter in a small saucepan over medium heat.
4. While butter is melting, place enough pretzels on prepared baking sheet to form a single, even layer.
5. Once butter has melted, add brown sugar and stir well. Allow to simmer and bubble, but do not let it boil. Adjust temperature to low if needed.
6. Stir butter-sugar mixture occasionally. It should take about 3 minutes to caramelize. Keep close eye as it will burn quickly.
7. When caramelized, pour mixture evenly over pretzels, strafing back and forth down the length of the sheet. Caramel hardens quickly so pour evenly and quickly.
8. If there are clumps, use an offset spatula to spread the caramel.
9. Bake for 5-7 minutes.
10. Allow to cool completely.
11. Microwave chocolate chips in 30-second intervals, stirring after each, until smooth (only a couple minutes).
12. Pour chocolate over pretzel-caramel mixture, strafing down the length of baking sheet. Move evenly and quickly.
13. Use offset spatula to smooth out clumps or thick spots.
14. Sprinkle sea salt evenly over chocolate before it starts to harden.
15. Allow to harden in fridge for at least 1 hour.
16. When hardened, remove from fridge and carefully pull aluminum foil off the back.
17. Break the bark into pieces and serve.
