## Ingredients
- Chicken breasts (quantity not specified), cut into strips
- 2 cans coconut milk (or more)
- Green curry paste (quantity not specified)
- Fish sauce
- Brown sugar
- Salt
- Broccoli
- Mushrooms
- Bell pepper
- Fresh chile (optional)
- Lime juice
- Fresh basil
- Fresh mint

## Instructions
1. Freeze chicken for 15 minutes to make it easier to cut, then cut into strips.
2. Carefully spoon off about 1 cup of the top layer of cream from one can of coconut milk - this layer will be thick and possibly solid.
3. Place the coconut cream and curry paste in a large Dutch oven and bring to a simmer over high heat, whisking to blend, about 2 minutes.
4. Maintain this brisk simmer and whisk frequently until almost all of the liquid evaporates, 3 to 5 minutes.
5. Reduce the heat to medium-high and whisk constantly until the cream separates into a puddle of colored oil and coconut solids, 3 to 8 minutes. (You should hear the curry paste starting to fry in the oil.)
6. Continue cooking until the curry paste is very aromatic, 1 to 2 minutes.
7. Whisk in the remaining coconut milk, the fish sauce, and the brown sugar.
8. Bring back to a brisk simmer and cook until the flavors meld and the sauce thickens, about 5 minutes.
9. Season the chicken with salt and add it to the pot, stirring until the pieces are separated and evenly coated with the sauce, about 1 minute.
10. Stir in the broccoli and mushrooms and bring back to a brisk simmer over medium heat.
11. Cook until the vegetables are almost tender, about 5 minutes.
12. Stir in the bell pepper and fresh chile, if using, and cook until the vegetables are crisp-tender, about 2 minutes.
13. Off the heat, stir in the lime juice, basil, and mint.
14. Serve immediately.
