# Vegetarian Dumplings

## Observations
- [definition] Recipe for Vegetarian Dumplings.
- [claim] Adapted from Alton Brown.
- [claim] Makes 35-40 small wontons.
- [claim] Press tofu with weight for 20 minutes to remove excess moisture.
- [claim] Can replace 1 teaspoon regular sesame oil with hot sesame oil for extra flavor.
- [claim] Keep wonton wrappers covered with damp cloth to prevent drying.
- [claim] Cook 8-10 dumplings at a time for 2 minutes, then add stock, cover, and cook 2 more minutes.
- [claim] Always freeze dumplings on parchment-lined tray, even if using within a day - much easier to handle frozen.
- [claim] Once frozen solid, can pop in freezer bag and keep for a long while.
- [claim] Keep dumplings separate on parchment - thin wrappers will stick and never come apart.
- [claim] Includes two dipping sauce recipes: Simplest Dumpling Dipping Sauce and Sesame Dressing.
- [question] What substitutions work well?

## Ingredients

### Dumplings
- 1/2 pound firm tofu
- 1/2 cup coarsely grated carrots
- 1/2 cup shredded Napa cabbage
- 2 tablespoons finely chopped red pepper
- 2 tablespoons finely chopped scallions
- 2 teaspoons finely minced fresh ginger
- 1 tablespoon chopped cilantro leaves
- 2 minced cloves garlic
- 1 tablespoon soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon hoisin sauce
- 2 teaspoons toasted sesame oil (or 1 tsp regular + 1 tsp hot sesame oil)
- 1 egg, lightly beaten
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 35 to 40 small wonton wrappers
- 1/3 cup chicken stock or water (per batch for cooking)
- Vegetable oil for pan

### Simplest Dumpling Dipping Sauce
- 1/4 cup soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon rice vinegar
- 1 tablespoon dark sesame oil or 1/2 tbsp dark + 1/2 tbsp hot sesame oil
- 1 small clove garlic, minced (optional)

### Sesame Dressing (adapted from Gourmet, July 2001)
- 1 (1/2-inch-thick) slice peeled fresh ginger
- 1/4 cup Asian sesame paste or smooth peanut butter
- 3 tablespoons Asian sesame oil
- 1/4 cup rice vinegar (not seasoned)
- 1 1/2 tablespoons sugar
- 2 tablespoons water
- 1 teaspoon Asian chile paste with garlic
- 1/2 teaspoon salt

## Instructions

### Prepare Filling
1. Preheat the oven to 200°F.
2. Cut the tofu in half horizontally and lay between layers of paper towels. Place on a plate, top with another plate, and place a weight on top (a 14-ounce can works well). Let stand 20 minutes.
3. After 20 minutes, cut the tofu into 1/4-inch cubes and place in a large mixing bowl.
4. Add the carrots, cabbage, red pepper, scallions, ginger, cilantro, garlic, soy sauce, hoisin, sesame oil, egg, salt, and pepper. Lightly stir to combine.

### Form Dumplings
5. To form the dumplings, remove 1 wonton wrapper from the package, covering the others with a damp cloth.
6. Brush the edges of the wrapper lightly with water.
7. Place 1/2 rounded teaspoon of the tofu mixture in the center of the wrapper. Shape as desired.
8. Set on a sheet pan and cover with a damp cloth. Repeat until all filling is gone.

### Cook Dumplings
9. Heat a 12-inch sauté pan over medium heat. Brush with vegetable oil once hot.
10. Add 8 to 10 dumplings at a time to the pan and cook for 2 minutes, without touching.
11. Once 2 minutes are up, gently add 1/3 cup chicken stock to the pan, turn heat down to low, cover, and cook for another 2 minutes.
12. Remove wontons to a heatproof platter and place in the warm oven. Repeat until all wontons are cooked.
13. Serve immediately with dipping sauces.

### Dipping Sauces
14. For Simplest Dumpling Dipping Sauce: Mix all ingredients together.
15. For Sesame Dressing: Blend all ingredients in a blender until smooth. Keeps covered and chilled for 1 week.
