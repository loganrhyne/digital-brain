- [question] What substitutions work well?

## Ingredients
- 1/2 cup chopped dill pickles (about 2 spears or 8 chips), plus 3 tablespoons brine
- 1/2 small red or white onion, thinly sliced
- salt and black pepper
- 1 pound green beans, trimmed
- 4 ounces feta, crumbled, plus feta brine for seasoning (optional)
- 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil

## Instructions
1. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Meanwhile, in a large bowl or resealable container, stir together the pickles, pickle brine, onion and a few grinds of black pepper.
2. Season the boiling water heavily with salt, then add the green beans. Cook until brighter green and just tender, 3 to 4 minutes. Drain, rinse under cold water until cool to the touch and shake very dry or pat with a kitchen towel.
3. Add the green beans to the pickles and stir to combine, then add the feta and olive oil and stir once more. Cover and refrigerate until cool, 30 minutes or up to 2 days. Season to taste with salt (or feta brine) and pepper before serving.
