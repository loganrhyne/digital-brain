## Ingredients

### Crust
- 1 cup whole-wheat pastry flour
- 1/2 cup unbleached all-purpose flour
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 1/4 tsp salt
- 1/4 to 1/3 cup ice water

### Filling
- 2 lb buttercup squash, seeded, baked, and mashed
- 1/2 tbsp olive oil
- 1 small onion, diced (about 1 cup)
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 14 oz silken tofu, mashed
- 1 tbsp fresh rosemary leaves, finely chopped
- 1 1/2 tsp salt
- Freshly ground pepper, to taste
- 2 tbsp arrowroot powder dissolved in 1 tbsp water

## Instructions

### For the Crust
1. Mix whole-wheat pastry flour, all-purpose flour, and salt in a small bowl. Pour olive oil in a separate bowl. Place both bowls in freezer for at least 1 hour.
2. In a food processor or with a pastry cutter, combine flour and hardened oil until it forms a coarse meal. Leave a few pea-sized pieces of hardened oil for a flakier crust.
3. Drizzle the water to the flour mixture, using only enough to form a dough. Take care not to overwork the dough, or it will become tough.
4. Turn out the dough onto a lightly floured surface and roll into 1/16-inch-thick circle.
5. Carefully place dough in a 9-inch pie pan. Trim and crimp edges as desired.
6. Place crust in refrigerator until you are ready to fill.

### For the Filling
1. Preheat oven to 350°F.
2. Slice squash in half and scoop out seeds. Place sliced side down on greased baking sheet and roast in oven for 15-25 minutes until a fork easily pierces the skin.
3. Allow to cool, then scoop out flesh, mash, and set aside. Leave oven on at 350°F.
4. In a large saucepan, heat olive oil and sauté onions and garlic about 7 minutes, until the onion is translucent.
5. Stir in squash, tofu, rosemary, salt, and pepper. Cook until warm.
6. Dissolve arrowroot in water and stir into mixture to thicken filling.
7. Pour the filling into pie crust and bake for 30 minutes.
8. Serve warm with salad or soup for brunch or lunch.
