# Almond Bear Claws

## Observations
- [definition] Recipe for Almond Bear Claws.
- [claim] Posted by Zoe, July 30, 2009.
- [claim] Easy style that kids love for appearance and taste.
- [claim] Uses brioche dough and frangipane (almond cream from ABin5, page 193).
- [claim] Makes 6 bear claws.
- [claim] Requires 45 minutes rest before baking.
- [question] What substitutions work well?

## Ingredients
- 1 pound Brioche dough
- 1 cup frangipane (almond cream - page 193 in ABin5)
- 1 egg beaten with 1 teaspoon water (egg wash)
- Sugar for sprinkling
- Almonds for decorating

## Instructions
1. Prepare a baking sheet with parchment or nonstick silicone baking mat.
2. Roll out the brioche dough to 1/4-inch thick rectangle.
3. Cut the rectangle into 6 squares.
4. Along one end of each square, put about 3 tablespoons of the almond filling.
5. Use a pastry brush to paint a line of egg wash just below the filling.
6. Roll the dough over and press it over the filling onto the line of egg wash. This will act as glue so the pastry won't pop open in the oven.
7. Allow to rest for 45 minutes.
8. Preheat oven to 350°F.
9. Use a pastry wheel to cut the dough into claws (about 5 toes per claw).
10. Fan out the claws and press the seam one more time to ensure they won't pop open.
11. Paint the entire pastry with egg wash.
12. Press the almonds into the ends of the toes and sprinkle with sugar.
13. Bake for about 20 minutes or until golden.
