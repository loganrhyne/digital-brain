## Ingredients
- 1 small bag small potatoes (Yukon Golds, fingerlings, or similar)
- Salt and pepper
- 1-2 tablespoons olive oil
- Optional: chives, fresh herbs for garnish

## Instructions
1. Place the potatoes in a large saucepan. Add a teaspoon of salt and cover with water. Don't peel the potatoes, because the skin helps keep the potatoes together.
2. Bring the water to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat and cook at a low boil until they are tender enough to slide a knife in easily. It is important not to over-boil them; for golf ball size potatoes, about 10 minutes or a little less.
3. Drain the potatoes and refrigerate until you are ready to brown them in a large skillet.
4. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Keep in mind it needs to be big enough to hold the potatoes, which double in size when they are smashed.
5. Smash each potato with a masher or the bottom of a heavy glass.
6. Season with salt and pepper and cook until crisp, and then turn and cook the other side.
7. Sprinkle with chives, fresh herbs, or whatever desired and serve.
