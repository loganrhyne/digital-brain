## Ingredients
- Fresh flat rice noodles (3/4 inch wide strips)
- 2 tablespoons oil
- Chopped garlic
- Sliced pork
- Light soy sauce
- Dark soy sauce
- Sugar
- 1 egg
- Chinese broccoli (or kale or regular broccoli)
- White pepper

### Condiments for Serving
- Sugar
- Fish sauce
- Vinegar
- Dried ground pepper
- Ground chili peppers (optional)

## Instructions
1. If your fresh flat rice noodles are not pre-cut, cut them into strips of 3/4 inch wide.
2. Cut Chinese broccoli into 2 inch long pieces. Halve the stems lengthwise because thick stems take longer to cook.
3. Heat a wok to high heat and then add 2 tablespoons of oil.
4. Drop in the chopped garlic and stir.
5. Add the sliced pork. Stir to cook the pork.
6. When the pork is somewhat cooked or turned from pink to light brown, add rice noodles. Stir to break up the noodles.
7. Add light and dark soy sauce and sugar.
8. Stir to mix the seasonings into the noodles and pork.
9. Open a spot in the middle of the pan, and drop the egg in. Scramble the egg until it is almost all cooked (not watery any more).
10. Fold in the noodles and mix them all.
11. Add the Chinese broccoli, stems first. Add half of the Chinese broccoli and stir until it wilts and then add the rest. (If you have room in your wok, you can cook all the Chinese broccoli at once.)
12. As soon as the Chinese broccoli is cooked, turn off the heat.
13. Put on a serving plate and sprinkle white pepper on top.
14. Serve with the usual noodles condiments: sugar, fish sauce, vinegar and dried ground pepper. Ground chili peppers and vinegar are good accompaniments.
