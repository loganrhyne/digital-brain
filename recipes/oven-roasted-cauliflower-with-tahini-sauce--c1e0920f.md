## Ingredients
- 1 head cauliflower, cut into florets
- 1 teaspoon salt, plus more to taste
- 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1/4 teaspoon black pepper
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 2 cloves garlic
- 1/2 cup fresh parsley
- 1/4 cup fresh chives
- 1/4 cup fresh dill
- 8 mint leaves
- 1 teaspoon salt, plus more to taste
- 1/2 cup tahini
- 1/4 cup lemon juice
- 1/3 cup water, plus more to taste

## Instructions
1. Add the cauliflower florets to large mixing bowl.
2. Drizzle with olive oil and then add the garlic powder, salt, and pepper.
3. Toss the cauliflower florets until well coated in the olive and seasonings then transfer them to a large baking sheet. Place the florets cut side down to help them get golden brown and crispy.
4. Roast the cauliflower at 425 degrees for around 25-30 minutes. Flip the florets 12-15 minutes into cooking.
5. While the cauliflower is roasting, add all of the tahini sauce ingredients to a food processor and blend until smooth and creamy. Feel free to add a few more tablespoons of water to the tahini sauce to thin it out a bit if you think it is too thick.
6. Once the cauliflower is golden brown and tender, but still has a little bite, remove it from the oven.
7. Transfer the roasted cauliflower to a serving dish or platter and serve with tahini sauce on the side. Enjoy!
