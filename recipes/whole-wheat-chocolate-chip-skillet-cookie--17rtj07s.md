## Ingredients
- 3 cups / 13.5 oz / 380g whole-wheat flour
- 1 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 1/4 teaspoon fine grain sea salt
- 8 ounces / 225g (2 sticks) cold unsalted butter, cut into 1/2-inch pieces, plus more for buttering the pan
- 1 cup / 5 oz / 140g dark brown sugar
- 1 cup / 7 oz / 200g sugar
- 2 large eggs
- 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
- 8 ounces / 225g bittersweet chocolate, roughly chopped into 1/4- and 1/2-inch pieces

## Instructions
1. Preheat the oven to 350°F / 175°C, with a rack in the middle.
2. Butter a 10 (25cm) or 11-inch (28cm) ovenproof skillet that is at least 2-inches (5cm) deep.
3. Sift the dry ingredients into a large bowl.
4. In another large bowl or stand mixer with paddle attachment, add the butter and sugars. Mix just until blended, about 2 minutes on low speed. Scrape down sides of bowl.
5. Add the eggs one at a time, mixing until each is combined.
6. Mix in the vanilla.
7. Add the flour mixture to the bowl and blend on low speed until flour is barely combined, about 30 seconds. Scrape down the sides and bottom of bowl.
8. Add most of the chocolate to the batter. Mix just until chocolate is evenly incorporated.
9. Scrape the batter out into the skillet, pressing it out into an even layer.
10. Sprinkle any remaining chocolate across the top, casually pressing it into the dough just enough that it isn't riding directly on top.
11. Bake for 35-45 minutes, until dough is deep golden brown along the edge and center has set.
12. Remove from oven and let cool a bit before slicing. Cut into wedges or small squares.
