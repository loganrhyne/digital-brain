- [question] What substitutions work well?

## Ingredients
- Meat, seafood, or tofu (quantity not specified, cut into small even pieces)
- Soy sauce
- Sherry
- Curry sauce ingredients (not specified in truncated document)
- Vegetables (grouped in 2-3 batches, not specified)
- Garlic
- Ginger
- Scallions
- Oil (vegetable or similar)
- Optional: whole basil or mint leaves

## Instructions
1. Toss meat, seafood, or tofu with soy sauce and sherry in medium bowl; set aside.
2. Combine all sauce ingredients in a second small bowl.
3. Divide vegetables into two or three batches according to ingredient list.
4. Heat 12- or 14-inch nonstick skillet over high heat, 4 minutes (pan should be so hot you can hold your outstretched hand 1 inch above its surface for no more than 3 seconds).
5. Add 1 tablespoon oil (2 tablespoons for tofu or fish) and rotate pan so bottom is evenly coated. Let oil heat until it just starts to shimmer and smoke. Check heat with hand.
6. Drain meat, seafood, or tofu, then add to pan and stir-fry until seared and about three-quarters cooked (about 20 seconds for fish, 60 seconds for meat, 2 minutes for tofu, 2.5-3 minutes for chicken). Spoon cooked meat or seafood into serving dish. Cover and keep warm.
7. Let pan come back up to temperature, 1 or 2 minutes. When hot, drizzle in 2 teaspoons of oil, and when oil just starts to smoke, add vegetables from first category.
8. Stir-fry until vegetables are just tender-crisp, about 2 minutes.
9. Leaving first batch in pan, repeat with remaining vegetables, cooking each set until tender-crisp, or for leafy greens, wilted. Add about a teaspoon of oil for each new batch.
10. Clear center of pan and add garlic, ginger, and scallions. Drizzle with 1/2 teaspoon of oil. Mash into pan with back of a spatula. Cook for 10 seconds.
11. Remove pan from heat and stir garlic/ginger mixture into vegetables for 20 seconds.
12. Return pan to heat and add cooked meat, seafood, or tofu.
13. If desired, add whole basil or mint leaves and stir-fry for 20 seconds until leaves wilt.
14. Stir in sauce and stir-fry to coat all ingredients, about 1 minute.
15. Serve immediately with rice.
