## Ingredients
- 1 cup cream
- 2 ounces butter, cut into a few chunks
- Salt to taste
- Freshly and finely ground black pepper to taste
- 4 to 6 swipes of nutmeg across a microplane, or to taste
- 12 ounces fresh pasta
- 2 ounces finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano (1 to 1 1/3 cups)

### Optional: Homemade Pasta (3:2 ratio)
- 9 ounces flour (2 scant cups)
- 6 ounces egg (3 large eggs)

## Instructions
1. Put a pot of water on to boil.
2. Bring the cream to a simmer in a pan large enough to toss the pasta in.
3. Turn the flame to medium low, add a chunk of butter and whisk or swirl it into the cream.
4. Add the remaining butter and whisk or swirl continuously until the butter is incorporated into the cream.
5. Turn the flame off or remove it from the heat.
6. Give it a solid three-fingered pinch of salt, several grinds of pepper, and the nutmeg, then cover.
7. Cook the pasta till it's al dente, a couple of minutes.
8. Drain it, and slide it immediately into the cream.
9. Toss it gently, then sprinkle three-quarters of the cheese over it and toss till the cheese has melted and the sauce evenly coats the pasta.
10. Serve, topped with a little more Reggiano.
11. If sauce is too thick, thin with a little warm milk.

### For Homemade Pasta (Optional)
1. Mix 9 ounces flour and 6 ounces egg (about 2 scant cups flour and 3 large eggs) together.
2. Knead till it's smooth.
3. Let it rest, covered, for 20 minutes or so before rolling it.
4. Run it through the fettuccini cutter.
