## Ingredients
- 2-3 heads of small cauliflower (or 1/2 head large)
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- A couple pinches of sea salt
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 1 small bunch of chives, chopped
- Zest of one lemon
- Freshly grated Parmesan
- A bit of flaky sea salt

## Instructions
1. To prep the cauliflower, remove any leaves at the base and trim the stem.
2. Cut it into tiny trees - most florets aren't much larger than a table grape. Make sure the pieces are relatively equal in size, so they cook in the same amount of time.
3. Rinse under running water, and set aside.
4. Heat the olive oil and fine grain salt in a large skillet over medium-high heat.
5. When hot, add the cauliflower and stir until the florets are coated.
6. Wait until it gets a bit brown on the bottom, then toss the cauliflower with a spatula.
7. Brown a bit more and continue to sauté until the pieces are deeply golden - all told about 6 minutes.
8. In the last 30 seconds stir in the garlic.
9. Remove from heat and stir in the chives, lemon zest, and dust with a bit of freshly grated Parmesan cheese and a pinch of flaky sea salt (if you have it on hand).
10. Serve immediately.
