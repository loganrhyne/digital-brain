## Observations
- [definition] Recipe for Banana Blueberry Muffins.
- [claim] From Alison Holst's Marvellous Muffins cookbook.
- [claim] Can use fresh or frozen blueberries.
- [claim] Better once cooled as moisture around berries needs time to disperse evenly.
- [claim] Bake at 200°C for 10-20 minutes until they spring back when pressed.
- [question] What substitutions work well?
