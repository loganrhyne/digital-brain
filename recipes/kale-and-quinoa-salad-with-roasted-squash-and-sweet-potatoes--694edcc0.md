## Ingredients
- 1 medium butternut squash (about 2 pounds)
- 2 large sweet potatoes (about 1 3/4 pounds total)
- 4 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon olive oil, divided
- 2 teaspoons kosher salt, divided
- 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, plus more as needed
- 1/2 cup quinoa, any color
- 1 cup water
- 1 large bunch curly kale (about 1 1/2 pounds)
- 2 large honeycrisp apples (7 or 8 ounces)
- 6 ounces feta cheese
- 1/2 cup tahini
- 1 large lemon
- 1/4 cup cold water
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 tablespoon maple syrup
- 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1/2 teaspoon chili powder
- 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

## Instructions
1. Arrange a rack in the middle of the oven and heat the oven to 400 deg F.
2. Peel and dice 1 medium butternut squash and 2 large sweet potatoes into 1-inch cubes (about 6 cups each). Place the squash and sweet potatoes on a rimmed baking sheet and drizzle with 2 tablespoons of the olive oil. Sprinkle with 1 teaspoon of the kosher salt and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper and toss with your hands until evenly coated. Arrange into an even layer.
3. Roast until tender and browned on the edges, stirring halfway through, 35 to 40 minutes total. Meanwhile, cook the quinoa, prepare the kale, and make the dressing.
4. Place 1/2 cup quinoa in a fine-mesh strainer and rinse thoroughly under cool, running water. Drain well. Heat 1 teaspoon of the olive oil in a small saucepan over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add the quinoa and cook, stirring constantly, until the water evaporates and the quinoa is toasted, about 2 minutes.
5. Add 1 cup water and 1/2 teaspoon of the kosher salt. Bring to a rolling boil. Turn the heat down to the lowest setting. Cover and cook until the quinoa is tender, about 15 minutes. Uncover, fluff the quinoa with a fork, and remove from the heat. Let cool for at least 15 minutes.
6. Strip the leaves from 1 large bunch curly kale and discard the stems. Coarsely chop or tear the leaves into 1-inch pieces and place in a large bowl. Drizzle with the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil, season with the remaining 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, and gently massage with your hands until you feel the leaves becoming tender, 3 to 5 minutes.
7. Make the dressing: Place 1/2 cup tahini, the juice of 1 large lemon (about 1/4 cup), 1/4 cup cold water, 1 tablespoon olive oil, 1 tablespoon maple syrup, 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, 1/2 teaspoon chili powder, and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper in a large liquid measuring cup or medium bowl and whisk until combined.
8. When ready to serve, dice 2 large Honeycrisp apples into 1/2-inch cubes (no need to peel) and add it to the bowl with the kale. Add the quinoa, roasted squash, and sweet potatoes. Crumble 6 ounces feta cheese (about 1 cup) into the bowl. Pour the dressing over the salad and gently toss to combine. Taste and season with more kosher salt and black pepper as needed.
