## Ingredients
- 4 bone-in, skin-on chicken breasts (or 4 boneless, skinless)
- Melba toast (quantity not specified)
- Oil (for coating crumbs)
- Egg whites
- Mustard
- Thyme
- Garlic powder
- Cayenne
- Salt and pepper
- Vegetable oil spray

## Instructions
1. Adjust an oven rack to the upper-middle position and heat the oven to 450°F.
2. Cover a baking sheet with foil and place a wire rack on top.
3. Process the Melba toast into coarse crumbs in a food processor, about twelve 1-second pulses. Spread the crumbs in a shallow dish and toss with the oil.
4. In a separate shallow dish, whisk the egg whites, mustard, thyme, garlic powder, and cayenne together.
5. Pat the chicken dry with paper towels, then season with salt and pepper.
6. Working with one piece of chicken at time, dip it into the egg white mixture, then coat with the Melba crumbs. Press on the Melba crumbs to make sure they adhere to the chicken.
7. Lay the chicken on the wire rack and spray the tops with vegetable oil spray.
8. Bake until the coating is golden, the chicken is no longer pink in the center, and the thickest part registers 160°F on an instant read thermometer, about 40 minutes (25 minutes for boneless).
9. Serve immediately.
