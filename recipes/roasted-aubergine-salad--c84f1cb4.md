2. Heat up the oven to 200 deg C / 390 deg F. Top and tail the aubergine / eggplant and cut it into half widthwise and then into eights lengthwise.
3. Lay them on the side in a medium size* deep baking tin and prebake for 10 minutes, then turn to the other side and carry on baking for another 10 minutes.
4. Add red onion wedges, celery, cherry toms, capers, pine nuts and chopped figs to the tray. Stir olive oil and minced garlic through. Season with dried herbs, smoked paprika, chilli (if using) and a generous amount of salt and pepper. Return to the oven and bake for another 20 minutes, giving the vegetables a good stir and adding balsamic vinegar halfway through.
5. Plate roast vegetables on top of farro or pasta on a large plate / platter. Sprinkle with fresh herbs and dot with vegan cheese.
