# Big Chewy Oatmeal-Raisin Cookies

## Observations
- [definition] Recipe for Big Chewy Oatmeal-Raisin Cookies.
- [claim] Source: Published January 1, 1997.
- [claim] Makes 16 to 20 large cookies.
- [claim] If you prefer less sweet, can reduce white sugar by 1/4 cup but will lose some crispness.
- [claim] Do not overbake - edges should be brown but rest should be very light in color.
- [claim] Parchment makes for easy removal but not necessary.
- [todo] Original has "Ingredients" header but ingredients list is missing - needs reconstruction from instructions mentioning butter, sugars, eggs, flour, salt, baking powder, nutmeg, oats, and optional raisins.
- [question] What substitutions work well?

## Ingredients
- Butter
- Sugars (white and brown)
- Eggs
- Flour
- Salt

## Instructions
1. Adjust oven racks to low and middle positions; heat oven to 350 degrees.
2. In bowl of electric mixer or by hand, beat butter until creamy.
3. Add sugars; beat until fluffy, about 3 minutes.
4. Beat in eggs one at a time.
5. Mix flour, salt, baking powder, and nutmeg together, then stir them into butter-sugar mixture with wooden spoon or large rubber spatula.
6. Stir in oats and optional raisins.
7. Form dough into sixteen to twenty 2-inch balls, placing each dough round onto one of two parchment paper-covered, large cookie sheets.
8. Bake until cookie edges turn golden brown, 22 to 25 minutes. (Halfway during baking, turn cookie sheets from front to back and also switch them from top to bottom.)
