- [question] What substitutions work well?

## Ingredients
- 2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil
- 1/2 cup white mushrooms (finely chopped)
- 1 medium carrot (finely grated)
- 1 pound lean ground beef
- 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1/4 teaspoon black pepper
- 1 large egg
- 1/3 cup old-fashioned oats

## Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
2. In a medium saute pan, saute olive oil with chopped mushrooms and. grated carrots over medium heat for about 5 minutes. Remove from heat.
3. Transfer to a large bowl and mix with the ground beef, spices, and egg. Mix together until uniformly combined, then add in the oats and mix again.
4. Spray two large baking sheets, or two 9 x 13-inch casserole pans, with a light olive oil mist. Portion meatball mixture into 1/2-ounce balls and place on sheet. Repeat until all meatball mixture is used (this should be about42 meatballs give or take based on the 1/2-ounce portion.)
5. Place in the preheated oven and cook for 20 minutes, or until internal temperature reads 160 degrees F. Remove and let cool before serving.
6. For beginner eaters following the baby led weaning approach, serve1 to 2 meatballs with a slice of avocado covered in hemp seeds. Consider serving with my Avocado Pesto Sauce for a fun, flavored-filled, nutrient-rich dip.
7. For beginner eaters following a traditional pureed approach, consider blending the meatball with the Avocado Pesto Sauce and spoon feeding the puree to your child.
8. For adults and moms who only have one-hand to eat, make it into a. meatball sandwich using the Vegan Coleslaw and Avocado Pesto Sauce as a fun topping.
