# Unfussy Apple Cake

## Observations
- [definition] Recipe for Unfussy Apple Cake.
- [claim] Best with boozy, slightly sweet whipped cream.
- [claim] Can substitute all-purpose flour for whole wheat pastry flour.
- [claim] Optional additions: quince paste, caramel cubes, toasted walnuts/pecans.
- [claim] I like this cake every-so-slightly under-baked.
- [question] What substitutions work well?

## Ingredients
- 2 cups sweet, crisp red apples, cut into 1/4-inch cubes (peel on)
- Juice of 1 lemon
- 2.5 cups whole wheat pastry flour (or all-purpose)
- 1 tbsp aluminum-free baking powder
- 2 tsp cinnamon
- 0.5 cup dark Muscovado sugar (or brown sugar), lump-free
- 0.5 tsp fine grain sea salt
- 2 eggs
- 1 cup buttermilk
- 0.25 cup butter, melted and cooled
- 3 tbsp large grain sugar for topping

## Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 400°F, rack in middle. Butter and flour a 9-inch square baking dish.
2. Place chopped apples in bowl of water with lemon juice. Set aside.
3. Combine flour, baking powder, cinnamon, sugar, and salt in large bowl.
4. In separate bowl, whisk together eggs and buttermilk. Whisk in melted butter.
5. Pour buttermilk mixture over flour mixture, stir until barely combined - don't overmix.
6. Drain apples, shake off excess water, fold into batter.
7. Spoon batter into prepared pan, pushing toward edges.
8. Sprinkle with large grain sugar.
9. Bake 20-25 minutes until just set and slightly golden on top.
