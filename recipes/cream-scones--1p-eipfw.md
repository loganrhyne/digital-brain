## Ingredients
- 1 large egg
- 2/3 cup cold heavy cream
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 2 tablespoons sugar
- 1 tablespoon baking powder
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 5 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into small pieces and chilled (70g)
- 1/2 cup currants

## Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 200°C. Ensure rack is in middle position. Line a baking sheet with baking paper.
2. In a small bowl or measuring jug, mix the egg and the cream.
3. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, salt and baking powder.
4. Add the butter pieces one at a time, using your fingers to toss the butter in the flour mix.
5. Using your fingertips, crush and rub the butter into the flour as quickly as possible. You'll end up with small tiny pieces in different sizes.
6. Quickly pour the egg and cream into the mixing bowl.
7. Using a fork, stir until everything just comes together.
8. Keeping the dough in the bowl, knead it by hand or use a silicone spatula to turn it a half a dozen to a dozen times.
9. Stir in the currants.
10. Dust a work surface and turn the dough out onto it.
11. Divide dough in half. Working with one piece at a time, pat the dough into a rough circle that is about 12-13cm in diameter.
12. Cut into 6 wedges and place them on the baking sheet. Repeat with the other piece.
13. Bake for 20 minutes or so, or until the tops are golden and just firm.
14. Transfer to a wire rack and cool for 10 minutes before serving.
