## Ingredients
- 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 large onion, chopped fine
- 2 carrots, peeled and chopped
- 3 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 teaspoon curry powder
- 1 (14.5-ounce) can diced tomatoes, drained
- 1 bay leaf
- 1 teaspoon minced fresh thyme
- 1 cup lentils, picked over and rinsed
- Salt and pepper
- ½ cup dry white wine
- 4½ cups vegetable broth
- 1½ cups water
- 3 tablespoons minced fresh parsley

## Instructions
1. Heat oil in Dutch oven over medium-high heat until shimmering. Stir in onion and carrots and cook until vegetables begin to soften, about 2 minutes. Stir in garlic and curry powder and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in tomatoes, bay leaf, and thyme and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in lentils and ¼ teaspoon salt. Cover, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are softened and lentils have darkened, 8 to 10 minutes.

2. Uncover, increase heat to high, add wine, scraping up any browned bits, and bring to simmer. Stir in broth and water and bring to boil. Partially cover pot, reduce heat to low, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until lentils are tender but still hold their shape, 30 to 35 minutes.

3. Discard bay leaf. Puree 3 cups soup in blender until smooth, then return to pot.

4. Warm soup over medium-low heat until hot, about 5 minutes. Stir in parsley, season with salt and pepper to taste, and serve.

## Make-Ahead Instructions
- Soup, prepared through step 3, can be refrigerated for up to 3 days or frozen for up to 1 month; if frozen, thaw completely in refrigerator
- To reheat, bring soup, covered, to gentle simmer, stirring often; adjust consistency with hot water as needed and continue with step 4

## Notes
**Why This Recipe Works**: This simple and appealing soup takes complete advantage of the delicate, firm-tender bite and deep, earthy flavor of properly prepared lentils. The recipe starts by sautéing plenty of aromatics, then adding the lentils and cooking them until the vegetables were softened and the lentils had darkened, which helped them hold their shape and boosted their flavor. Deglazing the pan with white wine before adding the broth and water and simmering the lentils until tender. Pureeing part of the soup ensured that the broth had a luscious consistency.

**Lentil Note**: Lentilles du Puy (French green lentils) are the first choice for this recipe because they don't soften in the fridge or freezer. Brown, black, or regular green lentils will also work (note that cooking times will vary depending on the type used).
