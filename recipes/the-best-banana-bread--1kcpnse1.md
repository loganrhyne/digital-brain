# The Best Banana Bread

## Observations
- [definition] Recipe for The Best Banana Bread.
- [claim] Source: America's Test Kitchen, March 1998.
- [claim] Greasing only the bottom of a regular loaf pan causes bread to cling to sides and rise higher.
- [claim] If using nonstick pan, grease and flour both bottom and sides.
- [todo] Original recipe has missing ingredients list - needs reconstruction.
- [question] What substitutions work well?

## Ingredients
- Dry ingredients (flour, sugar, baking soda, salt, cinnamon - typical quick bread ratios)
- Mashed bananas (about 3 ripe)
- Yogurt
- Eggs
- Melted butter
- Vanilla extract

## Instructions
1. Adjust oven rack to lower middle position and heat oven to 350°F.
2. Grease bottom only of regular loaf pan, or grease and flour bottom and sides of nonstick 9x5x3 inch loaf pan.
3. Combine dry ingredients in large bowl.
4. Mix mashed bananas, yogurt, eggs, butter, and vanilla with wooden spoon in medium bowl.
5. Lightly fold banana mixture into dry ingredients with rubber spatula until just combined. Batter should look thick and chunky.
6. Scrape batter into prepared loaf pan.
7. Bake until golden brown and toothpick inserted in center comes out clean, about 55 minutes.
8. Cool in pan for 5 minutes, then transfer to wire rack.
9. Serve warm or at room temperature.
