- [claim] Thai curry with special ingredients that can be found at Asian markets or Whole Foods.
- [claim] Eggplant absorbs oil quickly - add more if needed during stir-frying.
- [claim] Green curry paste will cause oil to spit when added - be careful.
- [claim] Cook eggplant until skin becomes lightly brown and blistered, about 3-4 minutes.
- [claim] Simmer curry paste with half coconut milk for 2-3 minutes before adding other ingredients.
- [claim] Serve over rice with lime wedges on the side.

## Ingredients
- Vegetable or grapeseed oil
- 2 Japanese eggplants, cut into bite-sized pieces
- 1 red bell pepper, seeded, sliced into sticks
- 1 can bamboo shoots
- 2 1/2 tablespoons green curry paste
- 1 can coconut milk
- 3 kaffir lime leaves
- 1 lemongrass stalk, cut into three pieces and bruised
- 1 tablespoon fish sauce
- 1 tablespoon brown sugar
- 1/4 cup Thai Basil or Sweet Basil leaves
- 1-3 Thai chilies, depending on heat preference
- Lime for garnish (optional)

## Instructions
1. Place a tablespoon of vegetable oil in a wok or deep pan over high heat.
2. Add eggplant and stir-fry until skin becomes lightly brown and blistered, and the eggplant insides begin to soften and get a slight sear, about 3 to 4 minutes. The eggplant will absorb the oil; if some pieces don't get any, add a little more oil.
3. Remove from heat and set aside in a bowl.
4. Place another tablespoon of vegetable oil in the wok and heat over medium heat.
5. Add the curry paste (be careful, as it will cause the oil to spit) and sauté over medium heat until fragrant, about 20 to 30 seconds.
6. Add half of the coconut milk and mix, simmer for 2 to 3 minutes.
7. Add the lemongrass, kaffir lime leaves, fish sauce, brown sugar, and remaining coconut milk and bring to a boil.
8. Add the bamboo shoots, cooked eggplant, and bell pepper. Cook for 4 to 5 minutes until softened a bit.
9. Stir in basil and chilies and remove from heat.
10. Serve over rice with lime wedges on the side.
