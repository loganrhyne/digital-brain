# Nikki's Healthy Cookie Recipe

## Observations
- [definition] Recipe for Nikki's Healthy Cookie Recipe.
- [claim] Makes about 3 dozen bite-sized cookies.
- [claim] Can use unsweetened carob, grain sweetened chocolate chips, or dark chocolate (70%).
- [claim] Make almond meal by pulsing almonds in food processor until sand texture (don't go too far or you'll get almond butter).
- [claim] Warm coconut oil so it isn't solid for easier incorporation.
- [claim] For gluten allergies, seek out GF oats.
- [claim] Dough is looser than standard cookie dough.
- [claim] Bake just shy of 15 minutes without burning bottoms.
- [question] What substitutions work well?

## Ingredients
- 3 large, ripe bananas, well mashed (about 1 1/2 cups)
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1/4 cup coconut oil, barely warm - so it isn't solid (or alternately, olive oil)
- 2 cups rolled oats
- 2/3 cup almond meal
- 1/3 cup coconut, finely shredded & unsweetened
- 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
- 1/2 teaspoon fine grain sea salt
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 6-7 ounces chocolate chips or dark chocolate bar chopped

## Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 350°F, racks in the top third.
2. In a large bowl combine the bananas, vanilla extract, and coconut oil. Set aside.
3. In another bowl whisk together the oats, almond meal, shredded coconut, cinnamon, salt, and baking powder.
4. Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and stir until combined.
5. Fold in the chocolate chunks/chips.
6. Drop dollops of the dough, each about 2 teaspoons in size, an inch apart, onto a parchment (or Silpat) lined baking sheet.
7. Bake for 12-14 minutes (just shy of 15 minutes seems about right).
