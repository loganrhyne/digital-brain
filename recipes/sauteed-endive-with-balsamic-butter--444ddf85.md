- [question] What substitutions work well?

## Ingredients
- 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
- 3 medium-small heads belgian endive, trimmed, halved vertically
- fine sea salt
- 2 tablespoons good-quality balsamic vinegar
- 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, in small pieces
- pinch of sugar
- coarsely ground black pepper
- 3 tablespoons fresh marjoram or oregano leaves

## Instructions
1. Heat oil in a heavy skillet. Add endive halves, cut side down, and sear on medium-high heat for a couple of minutes per side, turning once, until golden brown but still somewhat firm in the middle. Salt to taste, transfer to a serving dish and tent with foil to keep warm.
2. Simmer vinegar in a small saucepan for about a minute. Remove from heat and whisk in butter bit by bit. Whisk in sugar and, if desired, some salt and pepper.
3. Drizzle some of the balsamic butter on endives, strew with marjoram and dust with pepper. Serve. Remaining balsamic butter can be refrigerated for future use.
