# Alison Gopnik on Childhood Learning, AI as a Cultural Technology, and Rethinking Nature vs. Nurture

## Observations
- [summary] Professor Alison Gopnik discusses how children learn like scientists using Bayesian reasoning, critiques the nature vs. nurture dichotomy, and argues that AI should be viewed as a cultural technology rather than artificial general intelligence.
- [key-point] Babies may be more conscious than adults due to richer sensory experience before narrative compression develops
- [key-point] Children can be more Bayesian than adult scientists, who tend to move predictably in revising their views rather than following true Bayesian updating
- [key-point] AI like GPT works by pattern matching from human knowledge rather than genuine novel reasoning - it's more like a sophisticated library than a thinking entity
- [key-point] Traditional twin studies and nature/nurture frameworks are too simplistic - the PKU example shows genes only matter in specific environmental contexts
- [question] How should K-12 education change in response to generative AI's capabilities?
- [question] What is the relationship between autism diagnosis and actual cognitive variation in the population?
- [claim] Inquiry-based, play-based education is optimal for children under 7, while apprenticeship models work better for older students

## Transcript

TYLER COWEN: Hello, everyone, and welcome back to Conversations with Tyler. Today, I am talking with Alison Gopnik. She is a professor of psychology and also philosophy at University of California at Berkeley. She is a very well-known expert in fields of human learning and also child developmental psychology, among other things. She has written extensively for the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, where she was a columnist for 10 years, Atlantic magazine, and dozens of other places, all of which you will have heard of. Alison, welcome.

ALISON GOPNIK: Thank you.

COWEN: Now, one hypothesis you're known for is this idea that the way children learn has a lot in common with the way that human scientists learn. What's your basic model of how human scientists learn?

GOPNIK: This is interesting. When we started this out, one of the big puzzles that we had was, it's fine to say that children are learning like scientists, but then the question became, how are scientists learning? When I started this project, a lot of the philosophers of science said, "Kuhn showed that there was nothing systematic you could say about that. It's just sociology." But interestingly, during the time that I've been working, there's been this real change in the way that people think about philosophy of science.

COWEN: Are human scientists ever Bayesian? I think of them as not very Bayesian at all, that they're mostly pretty stubborn.

GOPNIK: It's interesting. One of the things that we've looked at is whether little kids are Bayesian, and you might be even more surprised to find that little kids are actually being pretty rational Bayesian, but a lot of it depends on how you ask.

COWEN: I think of the kids as much more Bayesian than the scientists, and here's what worries me about the scientists. When they revise their views, the direction in which they move is almost always predictable. If they're, say, thinking over decades, how much does the money supply matter? They'll move a bit in the direction of thinking it matters. Then they'll move a bit more. Then finally, they might decide, well, it matters quite a bit. It shouldn't be predictable if they're Bayesian. It should be more like a random walk. Basically, they're stubborn.

GOPNIK: There's a beautiful idea that I've been using thinking about the kids that is in computer science. It actually comes from physics called simulated annealing. The idea behind simulated annealing is that you have some problem to solve. You have some space of solutions that you're trying to get to.

COWEN: Here's a few things a four-year-old might do. I'm going to ask you which one is the most Bayesian. A four-year-old pulls his sister's hair, a four-year-old tries to figure out how to use a fork properly, and a four-year-old tries to put together the pieces of a puzzle. Or pick your own nomination. In which do we see the child being the most Bayesian and then the least Bayesian?

GOPNIK: That's an interesting case. It's funny, when you said tries to use the fork properly, that's a matter of conforming to a norm, but if you just —

COWEN: To get food into his mouth, right? At least to do that. I don't mean proper manners in the Ann Landers sense.

GOPNIK: Yes. I don't think any of those are really an example of the kind of exploration that I think is trying to get new evidence to change your theory. I think there are lots of things that you'll see the kids doing. For instance, the fork is a good example. I have a lovely video of my son that I use to do teaching. He has a spoon, and he's trying to eat an avocado with a spoon. Of course, eating an avocado with a spoon when you're two years old is extremely challenging. It's a full avocado.

COWEN: There's an alternative vision of how people learn, if learning's even the right word, and it comes from Karl Friston. I think of it as a minimized surprise kind of theory, that you're confronted with data from the world, and then you interpret the data and coordinate your actions in such a way to minimize surprise. That will imply a lot of cognitive biases, but that's his basic model of humans. What do you think of that theory?

GOPNIK: I think it's very underspecified. There's this category of theories in science of things that have a good combination of intuitively being in the right direction and then have a lot of math, but it's actually very hard to connect them to experiments and to an empirical research program. I think there's something right about the fact that children and people in general, when they're learning, are looking for violations of their predictions and something like surprise. But I'm a little skeptical about whether that formalism isn't going to end up accounting for everything. I think it's one of those kinds of theories.

COWEN: Let's say you have $100 million unconstrained to run experiments on young humans and how they learn. Now, there's an ethics constraint. You're not going to do anything you don't think is right, but what would you actually study with those resources?

GOPNIK: One of the good things about being a developmental psychologist is that it's really cheap, like little chairs and a little table. The thing we use for causal inference is about a $20 toy. There are some really interesting attempts now to use big data with kids, and I think that might be something that you could use a lot of money for.

COWEN: What do you want to test? Let's say you have that set up. You hire the assistants. You have the quant people. What hypothesis do you want to look at?

GOPNIK: Again, what I'd really like to know is, how is it that the kids experiment? If you just took that GoPro data and you looked at what did the child do? What happened just before the child did that? What was the consequence of what the child did in terms of their data, their experience? I think that would be really interesting to analyze.

COWEN: What does it mean to say babies are more conscious than we are?

GOPNIK: I should say, first of all, my view about consciousness is that it's very unlikely to be a single thing. There's a famous analogy that I think is right about consciousness and life. Life is an example of something that we thought, back in the 19th century, was going to turn out to be a simple thing, and there were whole research programs about what is it that makes a living thing living? It turned out that was just the wrong question, that actually there're many, many different kinds of processes that are all involved in different things that we think of as life. I think that's likely to be what will happen with consciousness.

COWEN: People who have very weak episodic memories — as you know, that's a thing — are those people less conscious?

GOPNIK: No. I think arguably, if you think about the children, for example — they don't have as much episodic memory, especially the little ones, like the two-, three-year-olds. I think that may actually be making you more conscious in the sense that, again, this adult tendency is to try to . . . You could think of it as trying to reduce, to compress the information around you into a particular narrative, like the kind of narrative you have in an episodic memory. A lot of times, as adults, what we're trying to do is take all this information, all this data, and just compress it into a single narrative, which is a very useful thing to do.

COWEN: If someone has aphantasia, they don't retain images very well, are they also more conscious for that reason?

GOPNIK: Aphantasia is a whole complicated story. Aphantasia is a puzzle about why it is that we have the kind of imagery that we have. It's not that people who have aphantasia aren't vividly experiencing a visual world; it's that they don't use that experience when they're trying to, say, imagine something or when they're trying to generate an image. I think that what the aphantasia work shows you is that business of generating an image when you're trying to solve a problem is epiphenomenal, that it's not that you're solving the problem by looking in your head and seeing the picture.

COWEN: If someone has aphantasia, is it somehow that the top-down processing is broken, and thus the image is not retained because some part of the digesting of the image doesn't happen?

GOPNIK: No, I don't think that's what's going on. I think what's going on is that all of us, in our ordinary experience, when we're doing something like making an image, are doing this cognitive work of generating a visual representation. The interesting, and I think contingent thing, is that some of us also have this feedback to our actual visual system, to our actual visual cortex. I think there's some neuroscience evidence that supports that.

COWEN: Aphantasia — it is pretty strongly correlated with autism, right? So, it ought to have some micro foundations in common with autism.

GOPNIK: I don't think so. I don't think that's right. It may be that people with autism . . . No, I don't think that's right.

COWEN: You don't think it's correlated?

GOPNIK: I don't think it's correlated.

COWEN: You mentioned Pixar. From graphics and animation, what is it we learn about how babies process the world? Babies love animation; young kids love animation. What do we learn?

GOPNIK: It's interesting. I think we all thought, to begin with, that when we were talking to, say, the animators at Pixar, there'd be great insights into things like facial expressions. One thing we do know with babies is that from the time babies are born, they're incredibly tuned into facial expressions and the way that facial expressions indicate emotions, for instance.

COWEN: Is there anything in Freud's understanding of childhood that's really held up?

GOPNIK: That's a good question and a complicated question. When I first started doing the work that we do now, Freud was — and Freud still is — I think rather surprisingly to the intellectual world in general — it just doesn't show up in modern psychology. Even having someone teach a class about Freud would be unusual. I don't think anyone does in Berkeley's department, which is the best department in the country.

COWEN: What in Piaget has held up the best?

GOPNIK: Piaget, on the other hand, still is, I think, the big theoretical foundation of what everyone has done since in cognitive development, and all of us — our attitude about Freud is, "Yes, well, of course, here's this little bit of something that turns out to actually be right." Whereas with Piaget, we're all trying to claim his legacy, that what we're doing is what Piaget was trying to do.

COWEN: Some of my colleagues — they're big fans of using twin studies to try to separate out nature from nurture. Do you find that enterprise convincing?

GOPNIK: Well, any science that people do is interesting. I think if you look at someone like Eric Turkheimer's work, one of the things that comes out of that is that your intuition to begin with, "Okay, well, we're going to look at the twins, and if there's a high correlation between what one twin does and the other twin, it's going to be nature. If there isn't, it's going to be nurture." I think increasingly, that kind of model has turned out to just be wrong. That's the wrong model. It's just too simple.

COWEN: What's wrong with it?

GOPNIK: Let me give you the example that I give when I'm doing my developmental psychology class. We know that there's a particular kind of disorder in a particular gene that means that you can't metabolize a particular substance in your food, and the result is that you have mental retardation and a lot of difficulties. We actually know pretty much what the gene is. We test babies. They prick their heel when they're born to see if they have this disorder. If they do, then we make sure that they don't eat anything that has that enzyme or that piece in it, and then they're fine.

COWEN: If the Turkheimer hypothesis is correct and societies are growing wealthier and wealthier, over time, virtually everything will be genetically determined rather than environmentally because we'll all be higher SES, we'll all have better environments, less likely to be crippled by polio in our youth or whatever, and it will just be about genes.

GOPNIK: Let me give you another example, Tyler, of the Turkheimer phenomenon that I think is interesting. If you look at smoking, for example, it turns out that when smoking was very available, when you did a twin study, there was a relatively small genetic contribution to whether you smoked or not. As smoking became less and less likely, and as there were more and more restrictions to keep you from smoking, then you start seeing what looks like more of a genetic effect, and it's because the only people who are smoking are people who have a very strong tendency to smoke in the first place.

COWEN: If it's something like height, where there is clearly an environmental component, especially if the child is not well-fed, but it seems perfectly fine to say above a certain dietary level, it's mostly genetic, right? No one says that's ambiguous, and more and more traits will become like that.

GOPNIK: Well, first of all, I'm not sure that's true. To a striking degree, the traits that people have looked at, like educational attainment, for example — we haven't found consistent relationships to genetics. I think the reason for that is exactly because there's this very complicated developmental process that goes from the genetics to the outcome.

COWEN: But say, what you would call the lay belief that smarter parents give birth to smarter children, at least above subsistence — surely you would accept that, right?

GOPNIK: Again, what does smarter mean?

COWEN: How you would do on an IQ test.

GOPNIK: What does genetics mean? It's interesting, Tyler, that IQ tests, for example — they have their own scholarly and scientific universe, but they're not something that we would teach about or think about in a developmental psychology class, and there's a good principled reason for that. The good principled reason — this has come up a lot in AI recently. There's this idea in AI of artificial general intelligence, and that is assuming that there's something called general intelligence.

COWEN: Say, in five-factor theory, openness is positively correlated with IQ, right?

GOPNIK: Again, even if you're thinking about what's happening in the personality literature, that's another example of reifying things that are going on. Again, I think an advantage of doing stuff with babies and young children is that we can actually look at what are the cognitive capacities specifically? How are kids learning? How are their computations affecting what they do? That's just very orthogonal from the whole discussion about IQ.

COWEN: Let's say you're called into a typical American K–12 school. Not a top one, but say 70th, 75th percentile, a pretty good school. They just say to you — maybe this has happened — "Well, you've studied all this about children. How can we improve how we teach our kids?" What is it that you tell them?

GOPNIK: I've written about this in my book. I think there're two different things to say. If you're thinking about young kids in particular, like early childhood, before 7, say, I think we have a very good model of inquiry-based, often play-based education, where you have a warm caregiver, and you get lots of opportunities to play and explore. I think we have pretty good reason to think that's the right thing for these very young children.

COWEN: Sure. We use it in economics. Yes.

GOPNIK: Yes, that's right. It's funny because I learned about it from my son-in-law, who's actually the chief quant for the Seattle Mariners. He was telling me about his difficulties in that job.

COWEN: Now that we have generative AI, how should that change what the K–12 schools do in terms of which qualities or features they want to bring out in the kids?

GOPNIK: My view about generative AI — and I've actually written about this in a paper in Science with Henry Farrell, who I think you know is —

COWEN: Yes, I know Henry.

GOPNIK: — a political scientist, and James Evans, who's a sociologist. Again, our intuitive lay conception of how AI works is really misguided. We very much have this golem view about here's this non-living thing that we've given a mind to, and that always works out badly. It's going to either be for good or for ill. It will be superintelligence. That's the narrative. We think the right narrative is to think of it as what I've called a cultural technology. It's a way of getting information from other people.

COWEN: That seems wrong to me. In your piece with Henry, you don't consider reasoning models. Reasoning models, in some way, "think." They can now prove some mathematical theorems. Almost every day, there's some new, albeit often minor, scientific discovery that comes from AIs that was not previously on the internet. Isn't the actual model of AI now — 2025 — quite different?

GOPNIK: I don't think so. If you look at the way that the reasoning models work, they work the same way that all the other models work, which is that they look at patterns of text on the web. One of the things that is a pattern that you have — again, this is positive — one of the things that you have are patterns of reasoning. What you have are patterns of, here's someone who was trying to solve a math problem. Here's the steps that they took to solve that math problem. Can I find a general statistical pattern in those steps and reproduce it in this other context?

COWEN: They do much more than that. It's clear they look at data on the web, but the people I speak to who build them say it's not transparent, even to them, exactly how the thing works, but as they apply more scaling, it gets better and better at its own reasoning. There's 01, there's 03, now there's GPT-5. GPT-6 is on the way. The scaling just seems to give it more ability to do actual reasoning of a unique sort that's not just copying the reasoning of some human.

GOPNIK: Well, that's the question. I think the fact that they're so good in this mysterious way at picking up patterns and reproducing patterns — that's clearly a really important thing that these technologies can do, but that's not what humans are doing, and it's not even what animal agents are doing. So, I would be impressed if they were actually designing experiments that would tell you something about something new that was going on in the world that all the other people around them didn't know before.

COWEN: They do that in biology already, right?

GOPNIK: The way they're reasoning is like a kid in a multiplication class who learns, here's what the formula is that you need to do for multiplication. It's interesting that they're not good at things like basic arithmetic often. You get this weird combination of it's reproducing a reasoning process that you could imagine in math, but it's not doing basic arithmetic. I think another place where they're really falling down is the novel relationships that humans are very good at generating.

COWEN: Hallucination rates are plummeting. If I use GPT-5 Pro edition, it will outperform a very good human lawyer for a typical query. It will do better on a medical exam than, say, a prospective doctor would do. I'm not saying there's zero hallucination, but they're already ahead of humans. If I took an economics test, GPT-5 would beat me.

GOPNIK: Right. That, again, gets you back to this point about what's going on in schooling. What we're doing is we're working out . . . Here's an analogy. Who knows more, you or the UC Berkeley library? Think about that example of the law case. All that legal information is there in the legal code. It's just that you don't really think about the legal code. You can access it, and you could access it better. You could have more of that legal information than any individual lawyer is going to have. You don't really think about that legal code as being a lawyer.

COWEN: If I write out a unique economics problem, it will beat most human economists in trying to solve the problem, a problem that no one's ever seen before. I create it. I write it down. I give it to the beast. I give it to some humans. Mostly, it beats the humans.

GOPNIK: Yes. Is it going to actually get a novel insight about economics that isn't there before, as opposed to it's just using the kind of apparatus that you already have?

COWEN: The demand curve will still slope downwards, but it gets the answer, and maybe the humans don't. There's something unique about that.

GOPNIK: It depends on the humans. The other thing to say is, we don't know. We'll actually see what happens. We'll see what the outcomes are going to be. I'm pretty skeptical just because we have been trying to figure out how two-year-old babies go out and solve the kinds of problems that they solve in the world, and they're solving problems.

COWEN: There're some papers in experimental economics. They indicate that autistic people — they're more likely to be Bayesian, and they're more likely to do better at game theoretic exercises than non-autistic humans. Should we infer from that that autistics have theory of mind?

GOPNIK: Well, this is another example of something where there's a simple, intuitive account. People have autism or people don't have autism. Again, I think the reality beyond just thinking about the spectrum is that there's a whole incredibly wide range of ways of interacting with the world, some of which you think of as being in the normal variation, some of which cause trouble for the people who have them, to the point of kids who can't speak, never learn how to use language, need to be taken care of all the time.

COWEN: Diagnosis of autism doesn't pick up or reflect anything?

GOPNIK: It's like dropsy. Diagnosis of dropsy in the 19th century was picking up something, which is that the person had swelling in their legs. I guess that's what dropsy was about, but it didn't actually track something that was going on in the external world about what was going on inside of that person. I think that's the situation with autism as well.

COWEN: How do you understand ADHD?

GOPNIK: I think that's another example where you have a lot of variation, and a lot of the variation is just variation in individuals. Some of it is variation in what it is that the culture thinks is important. Sometimes that variation is just variation. Sometimes that variation gets to be dysfunctional or cause difficulties.

COWEN: Andy Warhol — overrated or underrated?

GOPNIK: As you probably know, Tyler, I have a brother who wrote the definitive biography of Andy Warhol. I don't know if you did know.

COWEN: Of course, that's why I ask.

GOPNIK: Exactly. I wouldn't say that he's underrated, but he's definitely not overrated. He's someone who made a much wider, broader difference to the way that we think about artistic practice than other artists have. He kept doing interesting things. He kept doing different things. He kept doing things that ended up having consequences for what was going on with other artists.

COWEN: The movie Tár — overrated or underrated?

GOPNIK: You know, I haven't seen —

COWEN: Your brother's in the movie.

GOPNIK: I know my brother's in the movie.

COWEN: He's great in it. He's tremendous in it.

GOPNIK: That's what everybody says. Interesting question about why I didn't actually feel moved to see it, but I haven't, so I don't have a good opinion about it.

COWEN: There's you — you're tenured at Berkeley, you're famous. There's Blake, The Definitive Warhol Biography, and Adam, who's amazing, writes for the New Yorker, and you don't believe in heritability and IQ being very concrete things? I just don't get it. I think you're in denial.

GOPNIK: Actually, I think that example is maybe partly why I don't believe in that. In fact, what I do believe is that the effect of caregiving is to increase variability, is to increase variation. Our family, our care — there were six of us in 11 years. My parents were graduate students, and even before they were graduate students, they were that great generation of immigrant kids.

COWEN: Very last question: what will you do next?

GOPNIK: The big thing that we've been working on now, as I mentioned a couple of times, is this project about caregiving. This speaks to the issues that we've been talking about with nurture and nature and what the effect of caregiving is. Caregiving's fascinating because if you ask people, "What's most important in your life? What are your greatest moral issues? What's most meaningful to you?" They'll say something about "Taking care of my kids, taking care of my elderly father, taking care of my spouse."

COWEN: Alison Gopnik, thank you very much.

GOPNIK: Thank you, Tyler.

## Notes

This conversation provides excellent pushback against Gopnik's views on AI, particularly from Tyler Cowen's perspective that reasoning models genuinely "think" rather than just pattern match. The debate around whether AI is a "cultural technology" (like a library) versus something that does novel reasoning is particularly relevant given recent advances with models like o1, o3, and GPT-5.

The PKU (phenylketonuria) example is a powerful illustration of how simplistic the nature vs. nurture dichotomy is - the gene only causes problems in specific dietary environments, so it's neither "nature" nor "nurture" but their interaction.

Gopnik's critique of autism and ADHD as coherent diagnostic categories (comparing autism to 19th century "dropsy") challenges conventional thinking about these conditions.
