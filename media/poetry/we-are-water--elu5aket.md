# We Are Water

From *Mumblecusser: And Other Poems*[^1]

## Text

We will live with
our outrage the way
a river lives with
its rocks, shaping
and being shaped.
You are water, my love;
you are water to me,
quiet and patient and strong.
And cutting, over time,
through every smug
motherfucking cliff.
