# Piano Lessons

From *Mumblecusser: And Other Poems*[^1]

## Text

Children, learning piano,
ignore the pauses,
the helpful hesitations
that lend meaning.
They have yet to learn
that it's the silence
on either side of a note
that gives it something
to say. It's a lack of music
that finally makes music.
