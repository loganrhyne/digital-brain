# Throwing Rocks on the Gallatin

From *Mumblecusser: And Other Poems*[^1]

## Text

Consider the carpet
of them, the infinite floor,
the array of red,

blue, green stones, spread smooth
down the course of the river.
Infinite. But yours,

son, oh yours was the
only one to make such a
fine and pleasant plop

as it found its place.
