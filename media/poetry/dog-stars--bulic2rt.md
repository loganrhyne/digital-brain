# Dog Stars

From *Mumblecusser: And Other Poems*[^1]

## Text

Like you, I have a hard time with constellations.
Not just the frustrating, connect-the-dots nonsense
of imagined shapes but the assumption that certain stories
will help make sense of the infinite. Why those stories
and not some others? Why not *our* stories, is my thought.
Not Leo up there but Henry, my old black Lab,
ears cocked forward puzzling his way through a command.
Dead now fourteen years, that's Henry up there for sure.
I'm staking a claim. And why let the Pleiades keep
rolling around unchallenged when there's my grandfather
with his four fingers, one of them lost to a cane grinder
when he was a child? Instead of Ursus minor and major
why not that mule deer buck I killed in 1982
with its perfect, star-shaped antlers? This is not,
as the Chinese would tell you, the year of the rat,
the cat, or the dragon. Rather, it's the year
of mortgage payments and construction paper,
crayons and glue sticks. It's the year of Costco mums
on the porch and Covid masks, maybe a new tennis racket.
Arguments on Facebook, friends won and lost.
It's the year of standing in the backyard waiting
for the dog to pee. Staring up at the emerging stars
and thinking helplessly, again and again, they go on forever.
They just go on forever.
